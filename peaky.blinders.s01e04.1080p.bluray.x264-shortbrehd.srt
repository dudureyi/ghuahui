1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:08,920
前情提要

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,520
当我达到自己的目的后
When I've achieved what I set out to achieve

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,600
我会告诉你枪藏在哪
I'll let you know where to find the guns.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,800
我该怎么做
So what shall I do?

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,310
接近他  查出枪藏在哪里
Get close to him. Find out where those guns are hidden.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,060
想要罢工的人  举起手来
Raise a hand if you want to strike!

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,440
我名单上的第一个人就是弗莱迪·索恩 
Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,640
划掉他吧  我把他纳入我们的交易条件
Well, cross him off. I'll make him part of our deal.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,810
让他们去死吧
To hell with them.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,360
他们越是想阻碍我们  我就会越疯狂
The more they try to stop us, the madder I'll be.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,790
这年头  家里有个共产主义分子会影响生意
Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business.

12
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,300
你必须离开这里
You have to leave the city.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,700
你也在和他们交战  对吧  肯波先生
You are also at war with the Lees, Mr Kimber, am I right?

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,900
我们合力可以打垮他们  但分而作战  就不一定了
Together we can beat them. Divided, maybe not.

15
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,110
天啊  他越长越大了
God, he's getting big now.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,410
-我长肥了  你还依然爱我吗  -不会
- Do you still love me even though I am fat? - No.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,890
一点不爱吗
Not at all?

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,170
你娶了我  你别想甩掉我了
You married me, now you're stuck with me.

19
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,280
伦敦怎么样
So, how was London?

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,350
革命之火处处燃起
It's crackling with revolution.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,560
白杨码头的人正在罢工
The Poplar docks are on strike.

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,920
我们的朋友们给了我们想要的东西吗
Did our friends give us what we asked for?

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,660
-多少  -200英镑
- How much? - 200 pounds.

24
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,120
你跟谁见面了
Who did you meet?

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,540
俄国大使馆的一个随员
An attache from the Russian embassy.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,840
在中餐厅见的面
In a Chinese restaurant.

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,690
我们的革命是国际化的
Our revolution is international.

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,730
而且它日益发展壮大
And it grows by the day.

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,960
浴   血

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,960
黑   帮

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,960
第一季   『人人影视英剧社倾情奉献』   第四集

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,510
贾玛尔  贾玛尔  你看见什么了
Jeremiah, Jeremiah... What do you see?

33
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,800
你妹妹和弗莱迪今早回来了
Your sister and Freddie got back this morning.

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,290
我试图跟踪他们
I tried following them...

35
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,350
但弗莱迪太擅长潜藏躲避了
but Freddie's so good at getting away.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,230
他就像鱼一样狡猾
He's like a fish.

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,860
好吧  你要继续捕鱼  明白吗
Right, well, keep fishing, eh?

38
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,130
我们要等到那些小子们就位再行动

39
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,790
最后下注了  别把房租都赌上了  查理
Last bets now! Don't spend your rent money, Charlie!

40
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,600
开始发令了  先生们
That's your starters, gentlemen.

41
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,180
不能再下注了

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,610
-我准时赶到了  -已经结束了
- I was here on time. - Finished.

43
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,760
我搞到内部消息了  我必须下注
I've had a tip-off, I need this bet.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,530
-比赛已经开始了  -求你了
- The race has started. - Please.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,730
不行
No!

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,320
行吧
Fine.

47
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,640
把他赶出去
Get rid of him.

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,810
我们说了不行  滚出去
We said, "No", now get out!

49
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,410
好吧  行  我走  我走
All right. All right, I'm off. I'm off.

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,310
-再见  兄弟  -明天见
- Night, lads. - See you tomorrow.

51
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,560
今天不错
It's a good day.

52
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,700
约翰去哪儿了
Where's John?

53
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,310
约翰去加里森酒吧了
John is in the Garrison.

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,860
他说他想开个会讨论家事
He says he wants a meeting about a family matter.

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,560
等他说完了
After he's said his piece

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,090
他就会回来顶替斯卡德伯特的
he'll come back and take his place with Scudboat.

57
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,190
斯卡德伯特  约翰十分钟后就会回来  
Scudboat? John will be here in ten minutes.

58
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,970
好的
All right.

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,740
5分钟
Five.

60
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
等等
Wait.

61
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,350
好孩子
Good boy.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,890
约翰
John?

63
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,210
把枪放下  把枪放下
Put that down! Put that down!

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,780
这是为报切尔滕纳姆之仇
This is for Cheltenham.

65
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,290
我们只是拿回原本就属于我们的东西
We're just taking back what's ours.

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,690
这里有钱  到处搜一遍
There's money here. Search everywhere.

67
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,960
好了  约翰  现在只有一个...不
All right, John. There's only one right... No.

68
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,020
现在只有一个人守着赌马房
There's only one man guarding the house.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
你遇到什么麻烦事了
What's troubling you?

70
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,210
波莉  你也知道玛莎死后我家里的情况
Polly, you know what it's been like since Martha died.

71
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,220
好人不长命
God takes the best first.

72
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,280
事实上  我的孩子们整天都在我身边晃悠
The truth is, my kids have been running bloody rings around me.

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,060
赤着脚  整天牵着狗乱跑
Running barefoot with the dogs until all hours.

74
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,150
波莉  给他十先令  买些新鞋
Pol, give him ten bob, some new shoes.

75
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,630
是想要这些吗  约翰
Is that it, John?

76
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,780
汤米  你最好不要插嘴这事
Tommy, we'd be better doing this without you.

77
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,690
你到底想说什么
Now, what's your point?

78
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,670
孩子们需要的是一个母亲
What the kids need is a mother.

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,130
所以我要再婚了
So, that's why I'm getting married.

80
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,560
那个可怜的姑娘知道你要娶她吗
Does this poor girl know you're going to marry her

81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,050
还是你打算突然地要求和她结婚
or are you going to spring it on her all of a sudden?

82
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,210
我已经求过婚了  她也答应了
I've already proposed and she said "Yes".

83
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,060
我看就像一个炸药筒要落地爆炸了
I think there's a shell about to land and go bang.

84
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,530
她叫  莉兹·斯塔克
It's, er... It's Lizzie Stark.

85
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,140
约翰  莉兹·斯塔克是个强大的女人
John, Lizzie Stark's a strong woman

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,030
我敢说她一定把客人们都"服务"得很好
and I am sure she provides a fine service for her customers.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
我不想听那个词
I WON'T hear the word.

88
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,320
明白吗  不要用那个词
Understand? Do not use that word.

89
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,140
哪个词啊  约翰
What word is that, John?

90
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,370
你心里清楚是哪个词
You know what word that is.

91
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,520
大家都他妈知道
Everybody bloody knows...

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,310
那大家都可以去死了
Everybody can go to hell...

93
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,530
"婊子"  是这个词吗  还是"妓女"
"Whore"? That word? Or "Prostitute"?

94
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,700
那个词如何
How about that one?

95
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,100
好吧  我要让大家知道
Right, I want it known...

96
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,670
如果谁再敢叫她"婊子"
if anyone calls her a "Whore" Again,

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,230
我就把左轮手枪的枪管伸进他们的喉咙  
I will push the barrel of my revolver down their throats

98
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,410
把从他们口中说出的话再打回去
and blow the word back down into their hearts.

99
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,650
男人和男人的鸡巴总引我发笑
Men and their cocks never cease to amaze me.

100
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,060
约翰  莉兹·斯塔克都没站着干过活
John, Lizzie Stark never did a day's work vertical.

101
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,210
她改了  明白吗  人是会改变的
She's changed. All right. People change.

102
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,610
就跟  宗  宗教信仰一样
Like wi-wi-with religion.

103
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,750
莉兹也有宗教信仰是吗
Oh, Lizzie Stark has got religion, eh?

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,770
不  不  她没有宗教信仰  但
No, no, she doesn't have religion. But...

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,460
她爱我
Well, she loves me.

106
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,550
听着  汤米  没有你的祝福  我是不会娶她的
Now, listen, Tommy. I won't do it without your blessing.

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,310
但在世上所有人当中
But of all the people in the world...

108
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,810
我希望你把这视作  勇敢的行为
I want you to see it...as brave.

109
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,480
是真够勇敢的
It's brave all right.

110
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,750
勇敢的意思是开创无人做过的伟业
"Brave" is going where no man has gone before.

111
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,700
至于莉兹·斯塔克  约翰  
With Lizzy Stark, John,

112
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,610
那真的算不上什么勇敢
that is really not what you'll be doing.

113
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,650
听着  汤米  欢迎她加入我们的家庭
Listen, Tommy. Welcome her to the family.

114
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,800
她此前人生坎坷受尽欺凌
As someone who's had a hard life.

115
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,380
好吗  因为  我需要有个人陪在我身边
All right? Because, I need someone.

116
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,060
孩子们需要有个人来陪伴他们
All right, the kids need someone.

117
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,090
汤米  我们被洗劫了
Tommy! We've been done over!

118
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,450
什么
What?

119
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,440
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

120
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,570
到底他妈的发生什么事了
What the bloody hell happened here?

121
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,610
李氏家族的人  全来了
The Lees. All of them.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,460
表亲  侄子  私生子都来了
Cousins, nephews, even the bastards.

123
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,240
他们拿走了一切可以拿走的东西
They've taken anything they can lay their hands on.

124
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,610
4个现金钱箱
Four cash boxes.

125
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,470
他们丢下了这些
They left these....

126
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,620
钢丝钳  他们为什么要留下钢丝钳
Wire cutters. Why would they leave wire cutters?

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,300
大家都别动
Nobody move.

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,190
我觉得我们的朋友们在玩游戏
I think our friends are playing the game.

129
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,950
-什么游戏  -波莉阿姨  别碰任何东西
- What game? - Aunt Pol. Don't touch anything.

130
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,560
伊拉兹马斯·李曾去过法国
Erasmus Lee was in France.

131
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,690
该死
Shit.

132
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,530
当我们撤退  把土地让给德军时
When we gave up ground to the Germans...

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,520
我们会留下陷阱  用钢丝来触发
We'd leave behind booby traps, set up with wires.

134
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,900
我们会同时留下钢丝钳  算是开个玩笑
And we'd leave wire cutters as part of the joke.

135
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,480
-这里某个地方有个手榴弹  -老天啊
- Somewhere in here there's a hand grenade... - Holy Jesus.

136
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,070
用钢丝连接着
Attached to a wire.

137
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,780
不要移动椅子  或者关门
Don't move any chairs or open any doors.

138
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,530
-淡定点  小约翰  淡定  -不
- Go easy, John boy. Easy. - No.

139
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,400
兄弟们  不  不在这里
Boys, no. It's not in here.

140
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,080
如果是在这里  应该已经爆炸了
If it was in here, it would have blown by now.

141
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,530
伊拉兹马斯送来的那枚子弹上写的是我的名字
It was my name on that bullet Erasmus sent.

142
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,460
他是会设陷阱
He's set a trap all right.

143
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,050
但他只想搞死我一个人
But he's set it up just for me.

144
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,330
芬恩
Finn?

145
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,240
芬恩  待在那儿别动
Finn, stay exactly where you are.

146
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,590
我在假扮你呢
I was pretending I was you.

147
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,970
你是开哪扇门上车的  芬恩
Which door did you open to come in, Finn?

148
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,400
我没开门  我爬进来的
I didn't. I climbed in.

149
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,400
我要你按照爬进去的方式原路爬出来  明白吗
I want you to climb out exactly the same way you climbed in, OK?

150
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,860
不  不  芬恩
No, no... Finn!

151
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,850
让开
Clear!

152
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,130
发生什么事了
What happened?

153
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,950
-你没事吧  -没事  差点炸死我们了
- Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. It could have killed us.

154
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,260
所以说你永远不该假扮我
That's why you should never pretend to be me.

155
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,830
明白吗  明白吗
Ok? Ok?

156
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,160
我帮你争取了十分钟和她见面的时间
I got you ten minutes with her.

157
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,950
你至少该说声谢谢吧
You can at least say thank you.

158
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,320
现在要见教皇都比见她容易
It's easier to get to see the Pope these days.

159
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,200
把手放在圣经上
Put your hand on the Bible.

160
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,830
我不信教
I don't believe.

161
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,460
反正  我到这儿来也不是为了说谎
Anyway, I didn't come here to lie.

162
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,800
争战让我们都有死伤
This war is cutting us all up.

163
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,680
一个小男孩差点被炸死

164
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,530
一个孩子

165
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,980
你们都是孩子
You're all children.

166
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,670
我觉得该到此为止了
I say enough.

167
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,460
你的孩子们试图杀死我  但没有成功
Your boys tried to kill me - it didn't work.

168
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,420
我想提出一个解决办法

169
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,550
我以为他是你的同盟呢

170
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,330
我打算背叛他

171
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,630
难怪你不敢碰圣经
No wonder you won't touch a Bible.

172
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,610
-我有雄心抱负  -你想玩两面派
- I have ambitions. - You want to play a switch.

173
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,380
我需要你那些手下
I need your boys.

174
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,550
去干什么
For what?

175
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,240
肯波不是背后动脑筋的人
Kimber's not the brains.

176
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,750
实际掌管赛马场的是另外一个人
There's a gadze who runs the races.

177
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,790
我在拉拢聪明人  但我也需要四肢发达的人
I'm collecting smart people. But I need strong men too.

178
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,060
你的那些手下们该清楚这一点
Now your boys should know this,

179
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,690
我们现在每三场比赛就可以操控一次由谁赢
we now get the winner in one of every three races

180
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,450
在比赛开始前就决定好了
before the race even starts.

181
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,540
不需要收什么粉笔费或博彩
No need for chalkers or rafflers.

182
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,810
我说的是确定的事
I'm talking certainties.

183
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,360
你跑来吹嘘说你要背叛某人  把他搞下台
You come in here boasting you're going to do someone down

184
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,980
然后又用同样的语气请我信任你
and in the same breath you ask me to trust you.

185
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,830
就我母亲这一边来说  我们是近亲
On my mother's side, we are kin.

186
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,120
我们来谈谈家族生意吧

187
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,690
艾达  能帮我搓搓背吗
Ada, can you do my back?

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,690
艾达
Ada?

189
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,680
我知道信封里装的是什么
I know what was in the envelope.

190
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,000
我看过了  是钱
I looked. Money.

191
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,270
你说我们在伦敦见的人是法国人
And that bloke we met in London who you said was a Frenchman.

192
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,800
其实是俄国人  我不傻  弗莱迪
He was Russian. I'm not an idiot, Freddie.

193
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,330
为什么风险都由你来承担
How is it you take all the risks

194
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,880
而钱都归斯坦利·查普曼
and Stanly Chapman gets the money?

195
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,690
那钱是为了共产主义大业
It's money for the cause.

196
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,040
你个瞎子看不清状况
You're blind.

197
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,430
如果跟你的哥哥们有关  那我肯定要瞎
I would be if your brothers had anything to do with it.

198
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,220
这事跟他们无关  只跟你有关
This isn't about them. This is about you.

199
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,040
和我  还有这个
And me. And...this.

200
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,730
你是个梦想家  弗莱迪
You're a dreamer, Freddie.

201
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,540
你广施钱财而我们却在这里穷困潦倒
You give money away while we rot in here...

202
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,600
你把革命一直挂在嘴上
and you talk about revolution.

203
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,280
我需要知道
I need to know.

204
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,590
你效忠于谁  弗莱迪
Who are you loyal to, Freddie?

205
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,700
我问了  "你效忠于谁"
I said, "Who are you loyal to?"

206
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,720
你跟这事有什么关系吗
Did you have something to do with this?

207
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,010
我问一位熟人要的地址
I asked an acquaintance for an address.

208
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,600
她说给我的唯一条件就是不要提到她的名字
She said she would only give it to me anonymously.

209
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,950
她害怕被别人报复
She was afraid of the consequences.

210
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,540
这是谁的地址
Whose address is it?

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,290
汤米  我觉得有个策略可行
Tommy, I'd like to suggest a strategy.

212
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,540
你传话说你有个地址要给我
Your message said you have an address for me.

213
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
匿名密报
Anonymous tip off.

214
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,440
斯坦利·查普曼的住址
The address of Stanly Chapman.

215
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,670
你保证过会给我找到弗莱迪·索恩
You promised me Freddie Thorne.

216
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,830
用这个来代替弗莱迪·索恩
This is instead of Freddie Thorne.

217
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,780
-没门  -督察
- No deal. - Inspector,

218
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,240
斯坦利·查普曼可是比弗莱迪·索恩更重要的人物
Stanly Chapman is a bigger fish than Freddie Thorne.

219
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,830
他现在拿着200英镑的现金
He is currently holding 200 pounds in cash.

220
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,190
是俄国政府资助给共产党的
Given to the Communist party by the Russian Government.

221
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,810
没错
That's right,

222
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,910
查普曼露出了狐狸尾巴
Chapman has snow on his boots

223
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,270
而你只要趁机一网打尽就好
and all you'll need is a shovel.

224
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,900
如果他招供  你就有证据了
If he talks, you'll have proof.

225
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,010
你甚至可能得到国王奖章
You might even get that medal.

226
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,520
现在
Now...

227
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,950
在我给你地址之前
before I give you the address...

228
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,670
我需要你保证
I want your word...

229
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,260
你会让弗莱迪·索恩和我妹妹
that you will let Freddie Thorne and my sister

230
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,820
离开这座城市
leave the city.

231
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,830
很好  我向你保证
Very well. You have my word.

232
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,320
我觉得我们的休战协议对我们两人来说
I'd say our little truce is proving productive

233
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
都是件好事  督察
for both of us, Inspector.

234
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
我能获得情报
I get the information...

235
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,520
和保护  而你
and protection and you...

236
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,020
能抓到布尔什维克分子
you get Bolsheviks.

237
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,340
但现在有件更紧迫的事
But on a more pressing matter...

238
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,480
我看丘吉尔已逐渐失去耐心了
I'm afraid that Mr. Churchill is becoming impatient.

239
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,990
而且我担心
And I fear that...

240
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,810
如果你不赶快把那批偷走的武器还回来
if you don't give back those stolen weapons soon...

241
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,590
我会遭到取代
I will be replaced.

242
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,260
那样的话我就完蛋了  那是肯定的
That would be the finish of me, that's for sure.

243
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,430
我跟肯波的交易结束时
When my business with Kimber is done

244
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,920
我会归还那批枪的  之前说好的
the guns will be returned. That was the deal.

245
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,950
我现在完全被你操控着
Then I am in your hands. Completely.

246
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,660
你握着全部的王牌
You hold all the cards.

247
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,320
但我希望不要赶在你决定
But I hope to God that my dismissal doesn't come

248
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,240
归还那批枪之前被解雇
before your decision to hand back those guns.

249
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,030
我这么说是为你好  因为
I say this for your sake, because...

250
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,250
如果我被解雇了  而且那是你的错
if I were to be fired and it were your fault...

251
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,980
我会做出连恶魔都自惭形愧的事
I would do things that would shame the devil.

252
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,940
我生起气来你就要小心了
My fury is a thing to behold.

253
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,150
比如说  在我在任的最后一天
On my last day in power, for example,

254
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,660
我会让你和你那些垃圾弟兄们
I would see to it that you and your scum brothers

255
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,700
脑袋被棒子和铁铲拍得稀巴烂
have your heads stoved in with mallets and spades.

256
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,350
包括你的妹妹
And your sister too.

257
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,810
她怀的孩子对我来说一点都不重要
That baby inside her would be of no consequence to me.

258
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,680
唯一会幸免于难的
The only one to be spared...

259
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,100
就是你的小弟弟芬恩
would be your little brother Finn.

260
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,270
他会被作为少年犯起诉
He would however be lifted as a juvenile

261
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,980
然后被扔进成人监狱里
and dumped into that part of the adult prison...

262
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,020
像他那样的男孩  在那里最受欢迎了
where men have most appetite for boys like him.

263
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,260
那可真是黑暗无边的日子了  谢尔比先生
That would be a dark day indeed, Mr. Shelby.

264
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,820
如果在你做决定前  我就被解雇了
If my dismissal comes before your decision.

265
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,220
你明白吗
Do you understand?

266
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,940
再提醒你一下
And know this...

267
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,150
时间不等人
the clock is ticking.

268
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,420
斯坦利  我们是警察  斯坦利  过来
Stanly, it's the police. Stanly, get here!

269
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,630
-你被逮捕了  伙计  -你们这帮混蛋
- You're under arrest, mate! - You bastards!

270
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,450
看看我们找到了什么
Look what we found.

271
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,490
看来斯坦利·查普曼的狐狸尾巴
It seems Stanly Chapman really

272
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,380
确实已经漏出来了
does have snow on his boots.

273
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,290
查普曼先生
Mr. Chapman...

274
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,530
你死定了
you're fucked.

275
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,160
他还是不说那钱是从哪来的
He still refuses to say where it came from.

276
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,770
我相信  好好说服他一番的话
I'm sure, with a little persuasion,

277
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,590
他会和盘托出的
he'll tell us everything he knows.

278
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,530
包括弗莱迪·索恩的行踪
Including the whereabouts of Freddie Thorne.

279
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,100
-长官  -你的想法都写在脸上了
- Sir? - Your face is a picture.

280
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,380
我以为你跟他谈好交易了
I thought you had done a deal.

281
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,200
原来你是这么想的
Oh, is that is what you thought.

282
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,130
你保证过了啊
Well, you gave your word.

283
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,330
我保证过
My word?

284
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,720
在现在这个愚蠢的年代  人们还在乎这种事呢
Do people still talk about such things this idiotic century?

285
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,440
我向谁保证过
My word to who?

286
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,320
向一个剃刀党成员吗
To a Peaky Blinder?

287
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,880
现在  去好好审讯查普曼先生
Now, go and interrogate Mr. Chapman

288
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
直到他告诉我们在哪儿
until he tells us where

289
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,520
能找到弗莱迪·索恩和他的妻子
we can find Freddie Thorne and his wife.

290
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,170
找到钱的来源是次要的
The source of the money is of secondary importance.

291
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,440
你认为我对谢尔比采取行动是出于私人恩怨吗
You think my campaign against Shelby has become personal?

292
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,700
没错
Correct.

293
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,990
完全正确  在伦敦他们会这么说
"Spot-on", as they say in London society.

294
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,570
现在去审讯查普曼先生
Now, go and interrogate Mr. Chapman

295
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,200
记得下手不要太温柔
and do not make the mistake of being too gentle.

296
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,740
明白  长官
Right, sir.

297
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,380
今天是她的诞辰
Today's her birthday.

298
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,910
我就知道你不会不来的
I know you never miss it.

299
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,450
幸好你不是警察
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

300
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,250
你想怎么样
What do you want?

301
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,920
我是来警告你的
I came to warn you.

302
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,190
他们已经抓住了斯坦利·查普曼
They've lifted Stanly Chapman.

303
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,660
你怎么知道的  警方并未透漏任何信息
How do you know? Police don't spill that information.

304
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,290
我知道是因为是我和汤米告的密
I know cos it was me and Tommy who tipped them off.

305
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,620
汤米跟他做了个交易
Tommy did a deal.

306
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,240
为了让你和艾达安全离开
In return for safe passage for you and Ada

307
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,230
他告诉警方关于斯坦利和钱的事
he's given them Stanly and the money.

308
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,510
钱  什么钱
Money? What money?

309
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,750
-谁告诉你钱的事的  -你觉得是谁
- Who told you about the money? - Who do you think?

310
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,410
没错  是艾达的主意  她为了能搬出那个
Yeah, it was Ada's idea. That's how desperate she is

311
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,880
像老鼠洞一样的家已经不择手段了
to get out of that rat-hole you're keeping her in.

312
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,420
她不介意你知道是她干的
She doesn't mind if you knew

313
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,020
但她希望你知道真相时她不在场
she just didn't want to be here when you found out.

314
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,980
有时女人不得不站出来  就像战争期间
Sometimes the women have to take over. Like in the war.

315
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,090
你他妈以为自己是什么人
Who the hell do you think you are,

316
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,000
你个该死的谢尔比
you fucking Shelbys.

317
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,970
别站在你妈的坟墓上骂脏话
Don't swear over your mother's grave.

318
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,100
你们玩弄手段  认为地球就该绕着你们转
You play your tune, you expect the whole world to dance to it.

319
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,450
没时间让你在这浪费了  弗莱迪
You don't have time for this, Freddie.

320
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,190
你为了我做了交易
You did a deal for me?

321
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,390
别自作多情  是为了艾达
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

322
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,970
你以为那个警察会信守诺言
And you think this copper will keep his word.

323
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,730
如果他守了  你们就安全了
If he does, you're safe.

324
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,910
如果他没有  查普曼会供出你
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up,

325
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,320
你们还是要离开这里  结果都一样
you'll still have to leave town. Same result.

326
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,610
-很聪明啊  -那就快走
- So neat. - So leave.

327
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,990
除了你搞错了一件事
Except there's one thing that you got wrong.

328
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,330
斯坦利不会供出我的住址
Stanly won't be able to give up my address

329
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,950
因为他根本就不知情
because he doesn't know it.

330
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,080
组织内就是这么操作的
That's how it works.

331
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,470
我们都不知道对方的住址
None of us know each other's addresses.

332
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,770
看来你是浪费时间了
So, you've wasted your fucking time.

333
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,320
他们会一直拷打他
They'll keep beating him and

334
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,920
想要问出他根本不知道的情报
beating him for information he doesn't have.

335
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,890
你做的一切就是将一个好人判了死刑
All you've done is sign the death warrant of a good man.

336
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,750
那你不会走了
So, you won't leave.

337
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,200
不  我他妈才不会走
No! I won't fucking leave!

338
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,970
要我离开伯明翰
If you want me out of Birmingham

339
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,120
只有等我死了
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

340
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,620
如果你敢对艾达动手
You lay a hand on our Ada,

341
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,830
我会亲手送你进坟墓
I'll put you in a wooden box myself.

342
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,540
你养了个顽固不化的儿子  艾琳
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

343
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,020
你吩咐过我要继续审讯  我想先暂缓一下
You told me to carry on. I wanted to stop.

344
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
他好像癫痫发作了
He had some kind of seizure.

345
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
你杀了他吗
So, you killed him?

346
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,230
他告诉你住址了吗
Did he give you an address?

347
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,920
你到底怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

348
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,480
他不过是从楼梯上摔下来了
He fell down some stairs.

349
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,270
这里可不是贝尔法斯特
This is not bloody Belfast!

350
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,880
现在还不是  
Not yet,

351
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,710
但如果像他这种人得逞了  很快就一样了
but if men like him get their way, it soon will be.

352
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,060
再把他从楼梯上扔下去
So, find some stairs, throw him down,

353
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,940
然后去找验尸官
and call the coroner.

354
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,050
去找格雷森
Use Grayson.

355
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,230
如果他多嘴问起什么的话
If he has any awkward questions

356
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,470
问问他和萨尔特利那个情妇之间的风流事
ask about the welfare of his mistress in Saltley.

357
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,620
那就能让他闭嘴了
That'll shut him up.

358
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,110
我以前也住在这种破地方
To think I used to live in a shit-hole like this.

359
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,910
到处都是老鼠
Bloody animals.

360
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,230
但谢尔比确实为我们贡献不小
But the Shelbys really are doing an excellent job for us.

361
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,370
在八场赛马比赛里  我们没损失一分
We haven't lost a single penny to rafflers or chalkers

362
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,310
粉笔费和博彩费
in eight race meetings.

363
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,060
赌注经纪人很开心
The bookies are purring.

364
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,320
我们扔了块骨头给看门狗
So, we throw the dog a bone.

365
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,660
确实如此
I think so.

366
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,830
肯波先生  罗伯茨先生  下来看看吧
Mr. Kimber. Mr Roberts. Come and have a look around.

367
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,990
您先请
After you.

368
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,270
得了吧  弗雷德
Come on, Fred.

369
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,710
你吃中饭的钱就能养活半个伯明翰了
You can feed half of Birmingham with what you have had for lunch.

370
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,090
回去工作
Get back to work.

371
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,890
我们听说李氏家族的人把你的地方洗劫了
We heard the Lees had turned you over.

372
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,720
你不该听信谣言  肯波先生  这边走
You shouldn't listen to gossip, Mr Kimber. This way.

373
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,330
生意不错
Business is good.

374
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,770
特别是你现在知道哪匹马会赢
Especially since now you know which horse is going to win

375
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,640
就能提前设好赔率
before you set the odds.

376
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,250
很感谢你们提供的信息
Your information is very much appreciated.

377
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,130
好了  他们在哪
Right, well, where are they?

378
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,230
约翰  拉夫洛克  斯卡德伯特  都过来
John, Lovelock, Scudboat, in here.

379
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,710
这是我的团队
This is my team.

380
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,010
他们愿意随时为你效劳  肯波先生
They will take up their pitch at your convenience, Mr. Kimber.

381
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,240
约翰是记账册的  斯卡德伯特是负责赌注的
John is the book. Scudboat is the bag man.

382
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,020
当然  我们自己带保镖
And, of course, we bring our own protection.

383
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,120
去瓦里克  下周六
Warwick, next Saturday.

384
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,330
不许接近啤酒棚五十码以内
At least fifty yards from the beer tent.

385
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,840
先生们
Gentlemen...

386
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
还有女士
and lady.

387
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,020
我拿的是合法赌马的许可证
I have in my hand a legal betting licence.

388
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,030
由管理委员会下发的
Issued by the board of control.

389
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,960
谢尔比家族拿到了他们第一张
The Shelby family has its first

390
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,190
合法赌马许可证
legal racetrack pitch.

391
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,830
我们是生意人了  波莉
We're a business, Pol.

392
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,220
-恭喜  -给你看
- Congratulations. - There you go.

393
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,160
恭喜
Congratulations.

394
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,380
三十  四十  五十
30, 40, 50...

395
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,240
香烟有股怪味  亚瑟
These cigarettes have a strange smell, Arthur.

396
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,340
闻起来像臭水沟  你看
They smell like rotting water. And look.

397
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,300
有些被老鼠啃了
Rats have gotten some of them.

398
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,610
这是偷的  对吗
They're stolen, are they not?

399
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,040
别多问  
Don't ask.

400
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,280
它们藏在船上  所以有怪味
They smell because you keep them on a boat.

401
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,170
问这么多干嘛
What do you care? Now,

402
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,220
过来帮我看有没有算错  拜托
can you come and check my adding up, please?

403
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,750
你应该重新整顿一下这里
You know, you should make a new start with this place.

404
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,470
搞得像样点  那些香烟没法卖
Do it properly. These cigarettes are not fit to sell.

405
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,300
加利波利的味道
Smells like Gallipoli.

406
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,200
你应该找个新地方存货
You should find a new place to store them.

407
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,070
必须远离警察
It has to be far away from coppers.

408
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,540
-那老鼠呢  -码头都有老鼠  格蕾丝
- But not rats? - All the wharves have rats, Grace.

409
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,600
-为什么不放在干燥的仓库  -汤米下过命令
- What's wrong with a dry warehouse? - Tommy's orders.

410
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,910
什么命令  
What orders?

411
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,430
违禁品永远要放在码头旁的燃油船上
Always keep contraband near to petrol boat moorings.

412
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,420
船也会被搜查的
Don't boats get searched?

413
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,080
我们停在两河交汇处
We moor them at junctions...

414
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,250
有两条逃路
so there's more than one way out.

415
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,600
一英里内没有船闸门  所以机动性强
No locks within a mile so we can move that stuff fast.

416
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,510
你兄弟不守法律  却有自己的规矩
Your brother doesn't obey the law, but he has rules.

417
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,290
你兄弟真是谨慎啊
A precise man, your brother.

418
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,600
-我算的对吗  -现在对了
- Is my adding up right? - It is now.

419
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,240
一
One.

420
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,840
二
Two.

421
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,100
三...和四
Three...and four.

422
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,290
我们一个个搜
And we'll search them one by one.

423
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,680
祈求上帝  但愿我要找的东西在这里
Please, Lord, let that which I seek be found here.

424
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,560
没有子弹  长官  只有香烟和威士忌
Not so much as a bullet, sir. Just more cigarettes and whisky.

425
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,990
亚瑟说你问他
Arthur tells me you've been asking questions...

426
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,350
我们生意的事
..about how we run our business.

427
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,040
我们如何得到酒  在哪里储存
And how we get our booze and where we keep it.

428
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,590
我只是想帮忙
I am just trying to help.

429
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,230
我们走走
Let's you and me go for a walk.

430
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,260
-去哪  -来吧
- Where to? - Come on.

431
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,050
为什么来这里
Why here?

432
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,010
你是个虔诚的天主教徒  对吗
You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?

433
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,120
对
Yes.

434
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,610
那你就知道人们会来这里坦白忏悔
Well, then you know it's here people come to confess.

435
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,210
你先请
After you.

436
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,470
开始吧  格蕾丝
Well, here it is, Grace.

437
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,530
我坦白
I confess.

438
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,820
我需要一个人
I need someone.

439
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,030
肯波有个叫罗伯茨的顾问
Kimber has an adviser by the name of Roberts.

440
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,310
他口才好
He talks well.

441
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,020
替肯波记账
Keeps the accounts.

442
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,070
负责他们的合法生意  
Runs the legal side of the business.

443
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,410
你也想找个顾问
And you need a Roberts.

444
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,560
亚瑟说你点子多
Arthur tells me you have ideas.

445
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,670
我不是会计  也不是律师
I'm not an accountant. Nor a lawyer.

446
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,510
没错
No.

447
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,930
但你有我想要的东西
No, but you have something I need.

448
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,050
气质
Class.

449
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,580
重要会议时我需要仪表端庄的人
I need someone who looks right at the big meetings.

450
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,460
艾普森赛马会  阿斯科特赛马会
Epsom, Ascot...

451
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,610
-这是面试吗  -亚瑟说你很会算账
- Is a job interview? - Arthur says you're good with numbers.

452
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,920
那是相对而言  因为他太烂了
Well, that's relative. He is quite poor.

453
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,760
-你能整清账目  -因为太乱了
- You keep the books in order. - They were chaotic.

454
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,790
但你是个骗子
But you're a liar.

455
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,830
天主教徒进教堂时
No Catholic girl would enter a church

456
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,830
都会在胸前划十字
and forget to make the sign of the cross.

457
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,090
你真是洞察秋毫
You are very perceptive.

458
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,120
你先是谎报曾经工作过的酒吧
First, you lied about that pub you used worked in.

459
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,860
现在我又发现你是个新教徒
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

460
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,430
你在乎吗
Do you care?

461
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,260
不
No.

462
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,850
我撒谎是为了融入这里
I lied to fit in.

463
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,120
你倒酒时毫无经验
You pull a pint like someone who's thinking about it.

464
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,320
-这不是面试  这是审问  -坐下
- This is not an interview, it is an interrogation. - Sit down.

465
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,740
听着  格蕾丝
Look, Grace...

466
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,350
你来到了这个不属于你的地方
You washed up in a place you don't belong

467
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,590
我不管你是出于什么原因
for whatever reason.

468
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,970
-我很幸运  -或许我也是
- My good fortune. - And perhaps mine.

469
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,850
-我做的大部分事都非法  -我不是瞎子
- You know that most of what I do is illegal. - I'm not blind.

470
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,530
但你还是愿意为我工作
And yet, you'd still be willing to work for me?

471
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,900
你这是给我提供工作吗
Are you offering me the job?

472
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,640
我接受
Then I accept.

473
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,120
还有件事你应该知道
There's something else you should know.

474
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,470
我雇用你还有一个重要原因
A very important detail about my reasons for employing you.

475
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,320
你令我失望
You disappoint me.

476
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,300
你会辞职吗
Do you resign?

477
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,880
不
No.

478
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,710
我对这工作的兴趣反而更大了
My appetite for the work has only increased.

479
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,860
明天我带你熟悉工作
Tomorrow I'll show you around.

480
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,010
莉兹  你好  莉兹
Lizzie. Hello, Lizzie.

481
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,410
那袋子看起来很沉  上车吧
That bag looks heavy, jump in.

482
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,310
孩子们的茶
Kids' teas.

483
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,670
你喜欢孩子吗
You like kids?

484
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,550
-是的  -很好  约翰有4个孩子
- Yeah. - Good, cos John's got four of them.

485
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,890
放心吧  我不会劝你放弃
It's all right. I'm not going to try to talk you out of it.

486
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,060
我只是想谈谈
I just want to talk.

487
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,100
你不反对我们
You're not against us?

488
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,160
约翰能自己做主
John is his own man.

489
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,950
你也是
And you are your own woman.

490
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,910
莉兹
Now, Lizzie...

491
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,740
从法国回来后
since I came back from France,

492
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,840
我去找过你好几次
I've come to you on many occasions.

493
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,400
-汤米  你没告诉他吧  -没  我没有
- Tommy, you didn't tell him? - No, I didn't tell him.

494
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,240
正如你也没告诉他一样
Just like you didn't tell him.

495
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,450
你为什么不告诉他  莉兹
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

496
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,680
你为什么不告诉他
Why didn't you tell him

497
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,260
过去两年一直在接待他的哥哥
that you'd been serving his brother for the past two years?

498
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
因为往事已埋葬在过去
Because the past is the past.

499
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,130
我不想失去他  他是个好男人
I don't want to lose him. He's a good man.

500
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,110
我就希望你这么回答
That was the answer I was hoping you'd give -

501
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,750
"往事已埋葬在过去"
the past is the past.

502
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,440
约翰说你变了  我相信他
You see our John says you've changed. And I believe him.

503
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,550
这很好  改变是好事
And that's good. Change is good.

504
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,550
现在时代不一样了
These are new times I'm told.

505
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,430
所以我希望你们幸福美满
So I wish you both every happiness.

506
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,230
这算是我给你的结婚礼物
And I want you to see that as my wedding gift to you.

507
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,430
以及对曾经欢愉的最后回味
And our farewell to pleasures gone by.

508
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,080
你是说
You mean...

509
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,520
最后回味一次
..one last time?

510
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,350
最后一次  你和我
One last time. You and me.

511
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,120
整整八英镑呢
It's eight bloody pounds.

512
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,500
我们去哪做
So, where shall we go?

513
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,710
汤米  去我的住处吗
Tommy, shall we go to my lodging?

514
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,510
看来往事依旧啊
So, the past is not the past.

515
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,260
钱你留下  莉兹  下车吧
You can keep the money, Lizzie. Just get out of the car.

516
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,250
-汤米  求你了  -下车
- Tommy, please... - Get out of the car.

517
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,600
我真的爱他  汤米
I love him, Tommy. Really.

518
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,010
真的
Really.

519
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,140
约翰将自己下决定
John will make his own decision.

520
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,010
但我会告诉他事实
But he will have the facts.

521
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,360
你弟弟比你够爷们儿十倍
Your brother is ten times the man you are!

522
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,580
这点我毫不怀疑
Of that I have no doubt.

523
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,520
他显然不蠢
He is obviously not stupid.

524
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,750
我们只找到了被偷的烟草和威士忌
All we found was stolen tobacco and whisky.

525
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,130
你放回原地了吧
Which you left in place.

526
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,180
当然
Of course.

527
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,660
我永远不会危及你
I would never endanger you.

528
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,410
你干得很好  格蕾丝
You are doing well, Grace.

529
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,380
我在套亚瑟的话  他比较容易打通
I've been working on Arthur, he's easier.

530
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,750
-比汤玛斯容易  -是的
- Than Thomas. - Yes.

531
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,940
他没那么精明
Less intelligent.

532
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,820
对
Yes.

533
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,730
你会用"精明"来形容汤玛斯吗  
Is that a word you would use about Thomas?

534
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,900
那是你说的
It's your word.

535
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,920
他晋升了我
He has promoted me.

536
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,960
他想让我当他的会计和秘书
He wants me to be his book-keeper and secretary.

537
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,600
一帮暴徒还要秘书
A cut-throat gangster with a secretary.

538
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,470
这帮流氓矫情得动人心魄
The pretensions of these hoodlums are quite breathtaking!

539
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,240
不是吗
Are they not?

540
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,430
是的  很动人
Yes. Quite breathtaking.

541
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,930
显然他很中意你
He has obviously fallen quite heavily for you.

542
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,910
我以为你会高兴
I thought you would be pleased.

543
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,180
我只是希望你记得他是什么样的人
I just hope you remember who you are dealing with here.

544
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,570
一个剁耳切舌的人
A man who cuts off ears and cuts out tongues.

545
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,700
我知道他是什么样的人  长官
I know what he is, sir.

546
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,350
卧底最难的一点就是
The difficulty with undercover work,

547
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,240
时刻谨记自己是谁  格蕾丝
Grace, is to remember what you are.

548
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,700
我带来好消息  你却这样回报
I come here with good news and I get this.

549
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,600
格蕾丝
Grace!

550
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,360
汤米  帮我个忙
Tommy. I need a favour.

551
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,230
我想借一下车
I want to borrow the car.

552
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,290
我要带莉兹和孩子们去乡下转转
I want to take Lizzie for a ride in the country with the kids.

553
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,430
我们要庆祝拿到执照
We're going to celebrate getting the licence.

554
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,100
没问题  约翰
Not a problem, John.

555
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,970
我需要钥匙
I'll need the keys.

556
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,170
约翰  你是我弟弟
Look, John, you're my brother...

557
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,930
有件事我必须告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

558
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,940
昨天在车前座
Yesterday on the front seat of that car,

559
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,480
我向莉兹花钱买春
I offered Lizzie some money.

560
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,960
约翰  她同意了
And, John, she said "Yes".

561
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,810
那是事实
Now, that's a fact.

562
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,800
想怎么办你自己定
You do with it what want.

563
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,760
拿上钥匙
Take the keys.

564
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,910
带莉兹去乡下
Take Lizzie to the country.

565
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,290
如果你愿意  可以跟她结婚
Marry her if you want.

566
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,210
但你必须知道
But you have to know...

567
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,200
她同意了
..she said "Yes".

568
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,790
再拿个杯子
Get another glass.

569
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,340
你会祝酒吗
Can you make a toast?

570
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,270
我是爱尔兰人  祝酒最拿手
I'm Irish, I can make a million toasts.

571
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,900
愿你在被魔鬼带走之前
May you be in heaven a full half hour

572
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,660
先在天堂快活半个小时
before the devil knows you're dead.

573
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,820
我们在庆祝什么
What are we celebrating?

574
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,760
雇佣合同
Contract of employment.

575
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,950
会计  谢尔比兄弟有限公司
Book-keeper. Shelby Brothers Limited.

576
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,310
我不喜欢"有限"这个词
I don't like that word, "Limited".

577
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,960
要想被尊重  你必须加上"有限"
To be respectable, you have to be "Limited".

578
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,490
那也是我担心的
That's what worries me.

579
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,200
我装电话了
I had the phone put in.

580
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,110
就在后面
It's in the back.

581
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,230
如果谁也有电话  我们就可以打给他了
If we knew someone else who had a phone, we could call them.

582
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,990
既然我们在庆祝
And since we are celebrating...

583
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,570
这是我从拉克姆百货公司订的酒
..I had this delivered from Rackham's Department Store.

584
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,360
你能打开吗
Will you open it?

585
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,070
不
No.

586
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,880
留到特殊场合再喝
Save it for a special occasion.

587
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,640
对了  你为公司做的第一件事
Right, your first job for the company.

588
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,260
就是把这个送给我妹妹
I want you to get that to my sister.

589
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,890
我没见到她啊
I don't see her?

590
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,620
没人见到过  她在躲着我
No-one does. She is hiding from me.

591
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,790
我听说在女士专浴日  她会去蒙塔古街的澡堂
I am told she goes to a bathhouse on Montague Street on woman-only days.

592
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,940
她会伪装  所以我必须在里面有人
She goes in disguise, so I need to get someone inside.

593
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,550
我要送什么
What am I delivering?

594
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:40,000
一场家族聚会的邀请函  我要她到场
It's an invitation to a family occasion. I want her there.

595
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,440
告诉她当天休战
So, tell her there will be a truce.

596
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,600
我要送的是陷阱的诱饵吗
Am I delivering bait for a trap?

597
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,100
如果你仔细看这份合同
If you check that contract

598
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,450
就会发现上面说了不要问太多问题
I think you'll find it doesn't say anything about asking questions.

599
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,050
直接把邀请函给她就行
Just give her the invitation.

600
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,140
把那瓶酒放进柜子里  我叫你拿再拿出来
And put that in the cupboard until I say.

601
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,560
-搞什么啊  约翰  -我点不着烟枪
- What the hell, John? - I couldn't get it lit.

602
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,770
我连那个都做不到
Couldn't even do that.

603
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,730
你为什么要抽大烟
Why would you want to be smoking that for?

604
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,280
跟你一样的原因啊
Same reason as you.

605
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,220
脑袋疼
Pain in the head.

606
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,410
我跟莉兹谈过了
I spoke to Lizzie.

607
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,970
我把你告诉我的事更她说了
I told her what you told me.

608
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,110
她说  你哥哥汤米是个下流的骗子
She said, "Your brother Tommy is a dirty liar."

609
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,080
但之后我跟她妹妹和表亲们谈了谈
But then I spoke to her sister and her cousin.

610
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,150
给他们买了一些酒
Bought them a couple drinks.

611
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,150
他们说  她现在就接一些常客  仅此而已
"Just a few of regulars," They said. "That's all."

612
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,470
"为了不让饿狼来找麻烦
"To keep the wolf from the door,

613
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,370
她依然会接待一些常客
"She still sees a couple of regulars."

614
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,940
你一定认为我是个大傻瓜
You must think I'm an idiot.

615
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,430
我觉得你是谢尔比家族历史上第一个
I think you're the first Shelby in history...

616
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,370
在某方面有合法证件的人
to have a legal licence for anything.

617
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,270
我们的爷爷会怎么说呢
What would our granddad say, eh?

618
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,040
他会在坟墓里打滚
He'd be turning in his grave.

619
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,530
"老实工作赚来的钱"
"Honest bloody money? Eh?"

620
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,520
"在这个家里  就在这儿吗"
"In this house? Here?"

621
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,200
我们小时候  你总喜欢模仿别人的声音
You always used to do voices when we were kids.

622
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,550
我们现在不是小孩子了  约翰
We're not kids now, John.

623
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,070
但我们还是要相互照顾  对吗
But we still have to look out for each other, right?

624
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,470
是啊
Yeah.

625
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,120
是啊
Yeah.

626
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:22,290
来吧  回家去  睡个好觉
Come on. Go home. Get some sleep.

627
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,170
我们明天有大事要办
We've got a big day tomorrow.

628
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,710
有吗
We have?

629
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,740
明天  我们要永久性结束和李氏家族的战争
Tomorrow, we finish the war with the Lees for once and for all.

630
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,360
-什么时候变这样了  -就从现在开始
- Since when? - Since just now.

631
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,300
明天十点钟

632
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,290
准备好面对一切
Be ready for anything.

633
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:52,120
都下车吧  兄弟们
Out you get, boys.

634
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:56,430
准备好了吗  兄弟们
Ready, boys?

635
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,260
-约翰  准备好了吗  -是的  我没事
- John, ready? - Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.

636
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,300
来喝一口
Have a drink.

637
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,630
怎么了  干嘛都看着我  怎么了
What? What are you all staring at me for? What?

638
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,330
很好  我们出发吧
Good. Let's go.

639
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,040
怎么了
What?

640
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,920
汤米  你在搞什么呢  
Tommy, what you playing at?

641
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,310
我们进入猎枪打击范围了
We're in shotgun range.

642
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:36,960
约翰
John...

643
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,980
在你开战前
Before you go into battle,

644
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,290
你需要一样东西
there's something you are going to need.

645
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,470
你他妈是在干什么呢  汤米
What are you bloody doing, Tommy?

646
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,210
笑一个  约翰  这是个婚礼
Smile, John, it's a wedding.

647
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,430
-谁的婚礼  -如果我们告诉你了
- Whose bloody wedding? - Now if we'd told you,

648
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,660
你就不会来了
you wouldn't have come.

649
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,610
李氏家族有个姑娘  她会有一点狂野
There's a girl from the Lee family who's going a bit wild.

650
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,090
-她需要你去娶她  -滚开
- And she needs marrying her off. - Fuck!

651
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,000
-约翰  -你没权利这么做  汤米

652
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,210
听我说  听我说
Listen to me. Listen to me.

653
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:13,380
一个需要丈夫的女人  一个需要妻子的男人
A girl who needs a husband. A man who needs a wife.

654
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,240
汤米  我他妈才不要娶一个捡蘑菇的姑娘
Tommy, I'm not bloody marrying some fucking mushroom picker!

655
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,580
嘘  小约翰  听着
Shh, John boy, come on. Listen.

656
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,170
我已经替你许过婚了
I have already betrothed you.

657
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,340
所以如果你现在退出
So if you back out now

658
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,240
这里马上就会爆发一场血腥的战争
there's going to be one fucking mighty war breaking out here

659
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,510
那会让索姆河战役
that's going to make the Somme...

660
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,380
那会让索姆河战役相比之下就跟茶话会一样
It's going to make the Somme look like a fucking tea party.

661
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,070
但如果你娶了她
But if you marry her,

662
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,930
我们家族和李氏家族将永远团结在一起
our family and the Lee family will be united for ever.

663
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,930
战争也会就此结束  一切取决于你  约翰
And this war will be over. It's up to you John.

664
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,710
战争
War...?

665
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,320
还是和平
..Or peace?

666
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,690
放开我
Let go of me.

667
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:10,010
对嘛  你该看看她的嫁妆有多豪华
Right... You should see the size of her dowry.

668
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,640
她的什么
Her what?

669
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,260
她爸要送你一辆车
Her dad is giving you a car.

670
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,450
他行吗
Will he do?

671
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,130
他可以
He'll do.

672
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,540
她来了
Here she is.

673
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,200
她最好别超过50岁
She'd better be under 50.

674
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,720
过来  上吧
Come here. Go on.

675
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,120
我们今天是来参加
We're here today to join in matrimony

676
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,220
这位先生和这位女士的婚礼
this man and this woman...

677
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,970
你看上去很不错
You look well.

678
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,340
祝他们生活和谐  永不分离
And harmony and togetherness.

679
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,940
他们的婚姻得到了我们身边 
Which is sanctioned and honoured

680
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,630
两个大家族的赞许和支持
by the presence and the power of these two families around us.

681
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,570
约翰·迈克尔·谢尔比  
Do you John Michael Shelby

682
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,180
你愿意娶伊丝米·玛莎·李为妻吗  
take Esme Martha Lee to be your beautiful wife?

683
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,550
你收到我的邀请函了吗
You got my invitation?

684
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,000
格蕾丝说我们会休战
Grace said there's a truce.

685
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,250
家人团聚日
Family day.

686
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,210
你丈夫来不了吗
Your husband couldn't make it?

687
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,140
他不跟我说话了
He's not speaking to me.

688
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,180
当他开口的时候  
And when he does

689
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,200
就会骂我是该死的谢尔比家族的人
he calls me a fucking Shelby

690
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,070
尽管我现在应该是索恩家族的人
even though I'm a Thorne now.

691
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,280
对我来说你就是索恩家的  那是肯定的
Thorn in my side, that's for sure.

692
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,370
相扶相持
To have and hold...

693
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,420
我的天啊  汤米
My God, Tommy.

694
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,230
你羡慕他  对吧
You admire him, don't you?

695
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,600
仪式还剩最后一项
There remains one more part of the ceremony.

696
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,530
就是双方血液的融合
It's the mingling of the two bloods.

697
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:57,570
就此  两个家族将结合为一个
Where the two families become the one...family.

698
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,400
我现在宣布你们结为夫妇
I now pronounce you man and wife!

699
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,270
快点  约翰  快亲吻新娘吧
Come on, John, kiss the bride will you?

700
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,860
*我整夜睡在一个锅匠的臂弯里*
*Oh, I slept all night in a tinker's arms*

701
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,010
*他的手臂环绕着我*
*He put his arms around me*

702
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,940
*人群相庆  舞蹈跳起*
*Oh, there was folks and there was dance*

703
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,280
*爱尔兰人丢了班卓琴*
*And Paddy here's lost his banjo*

704
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,700
*我不愿离开我的宝贝*
*I wouldn't part from my sweetheart*

705
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,450
*不管是2便士  1/2便士或1/4便士*
*Tuppence, ha'penny or farthing*

706
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,390
*又来一群驾马车的男人*
*Another load of wagon men*

707
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,970
快点  再把我转一圈  
Come on, spin me round again.

708
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,520
你该让艾达小心一点
You should tell Ada to slow down.

709
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,840
你觉得她会听我的吗
You think she'll listen to me?

710
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,100
我试过阻止她  但她一直在喝酒
I tried to stop her but she's been drinking.

711
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,760
在那种狭小的地下室困了好几周 
Been stuck in that little basement for weeks.

712
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,060
好不容易出来了还能怎样呢
What do we expect?

713
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,640
她就像爆竹炸开了一样
She's going off like a firecracker.

714
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,290
天啊  汤米  快去阻止吧
Oh, Christ, Tommy, please...

715
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,380
够了  快过来  够了
Enough now. Come on. Enough.

716
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,850
好了  快来  坐下
All right, Ada, come on, have a rest,

717
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,040
-坐下  -快看啊  伊丝米
- Sit down. - Come and look, Esme.

718
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,060
看看你加入了怎样的一个家族
Come and look at the family you've joined.

719
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,850
来看看掌控这个家族的男人
Come and look at the man who runs it.

720
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,970
为他的兄弟选择妻子
Chooses his brother's wives for them.

721
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:37,320
他把自己的妹妹当老鼠一样追捕
He hunts his own sister down like a rat

722
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,600
他还想杀了自己的妹夫
and he tries to kill his own brother-in-law!

723
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,160
艾达  够了
Ada, that's enough.

724
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,270
现在  他妈的都不肯让我跳支舞
And now he won't even let me have a fucking dance!

725
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,740
-在婚礼上都他妈不行  -让她坐下
- Not even at a fucking wedding! - Sit her down.

726
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,510
冷静  艾达  艾达  冷静
Calm down, Ada. Ada, calm down.

727
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,650
该死的
Holy shit!

728
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,540
快拿水来
Water. Right.

729
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,980
别现在啊  艾达  该死的  你真会挑时间
Not now, Ada. Bloody hell, you do pick your times!

730
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,990
你人生中最了不起的事  亚瑟
Story of your fucking life, Arthur.

731
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,140
好了  我们到了
Right, we are here.

732
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,480
下来吧
Come on.

733
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,060
车不错啊  约翰  跑起来怎么样
Nice car, John. How's she run?

734
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,790
很好  很顺畅
Yeah, beautiful. Really smooth.

735
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,070
你妹妹在里面生孩子
Your sister in there giving birth,

736
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,510
你却在外面谈论车
you're talking about the bloody car.

737
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,560
-我们男人也帮不上什么忙  波莉  -除了去喝酒
- Not much us men can do now, Pol. - Except go get drunk.

738
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,620
-对  走吧  -有个男人该待在这里
- Right, come on. - There's one man should be here.

739
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,480
你说的对  波莉  弗莱迪该在这里
You are right, Pol, Freddie should be here.

740
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,760
我是听见你胸膛里的心跳声了吗
Is that a heartbeat I hear inside that chest?

741
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,840
休战协议到天亮依然有效  我发誓
The truce lasts till sunrise. On my oath.

742
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,270
告诉弗莱迪来这里没事
Tell Freddie it's safe.

743
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,340
艾达
Ada!

744
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,680
好了兄弟们  我们去痛快喝一顿吧
Right, boys, let's wet this baby's head.

745
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,990
继续用力  就这样  用力
Keep going. That's right. Push.

746
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,470
我觉得婴儿好像倒错位置了
I think it might be the wrong way round.

747
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,030
我给三位姐妹接过生
I tended three sisters.

748
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,230
是啊  你说的对
Yeah, I think you're right.

749
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,870
-我们该让她向前趴着  -快点  艾达

751
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,520
就快了  亲爱的

752
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,390
用力  二  三
Push. Two, three.

753
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,240
两个美丽的女人
Two beautiful women.

754
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,270
我该走了  该走了  今天是我的洞房花烛夜
I should go. I should go. It's my wedding night.

755
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,500
不  你坐下
No, you sit down.

756
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:34,570
有孩子要出生时  你最好别出现在女人当中
You don't want to be among the women when there's a baby coming.

757
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,390
再来一杯
Have another.

758
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,250
你觉得她丈夫
So, do you think her husband

759
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,000
会接受同样的建议  躲得远远的吗
will take the same advice and stay away?

760
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,070
不  弗莱迪会去的  什么都阻止不了他
Nah. Freddie will be there. Nothing will keep him away.

761
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,170
汤米说他去那里不会有事的
Tommy's said it's all right for him to be there.

762
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,830
对吧  汤米
Isn't that right, Tommy?

763
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:49,290
对  我今晚心慈仁厚
That's right. I'm all heart tonight.

764
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,210
你知道吗  小约翰
You know what, John boy?

765
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,460
我觉得是那个可爱的酒吧招待女
I think it's that lovely barmaid,

766
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,630
刚刚走出去的那个可爱的酒吧招待女
that pretty barmaid that's just walked out

767
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,670
让我们的兄弟变得心慈手软了
that's made our brother go all soft.

768
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,760
为这个干一杯
Drinks to that.

769
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,510

Come on, open up.

771
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,440
好了  亲爱的
There you go, love.

772
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,590
他可真漂亮
Oh, he's beautiful.

773
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,350
是个儿子  弗莱迪

开门  警察
Open up! Police!

779
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,440
弗莱迪
Freddie?

780
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,290
你们不能进来  有个宝宝刚刚出生
You can't come in here, there's a baby just been born.

781
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,030
弗莱迪
Freddie?

782
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,590
别伤害他  弗莱迪
Don't hurt him. Freddie!

783
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,370
你们伤到他了  别碰他
You are hurting him, leave him alone.

784
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,660
你们要将我从儿子面前带走吗
You're taking me away from my baby?

785
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,030
-艾达  -弗莱迪
- Ada! - Freddie!

786
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,130
你现在想让我打开那瓶香槟吗
You want me to open that champagne now?

787
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,730
是个儿子
It's a boy.

788
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,450
波  波莉
Pol? Polly?

789
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:04,230
波莉  波莉
Polly! Polly!

790
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,390
但警察把他的父亲抓走了
But the police came and took his father away!

791
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,000
你敢这样看着我
Don't you DARE look at me like that!

792
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,520
你个骗子
You liar!
