1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:09,060
前情提要

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,530
人们一直问东问西的  我根本不知道答案
They people keep asking me questions I don't know the answer to.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,620
现在手握机枪的是我们
It's us that have the machine guns now

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,710
焦头烂额的是他们
and it's them that's in the mud.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,800
枪支  谢尔比先生  我们愿意出大价钱
Guns, Mr Shelby. We'd pay good money.

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,760
你们是代表谁在谈
For who do you speak?

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,070
爱尔兰共和军
The Irish Republican Army.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,620
你是什么人  警察吗
What are you? A copper?

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,820
你因为他是爱尔兰共和军才跟踪他
You went after him because he was IRA.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,500
我跟着他是因为我以为他身上有情报
I followed him because I thought he might have information.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,630
卧底最难的一点就是
The difficulty with undercover work,

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,710
时刻谨记自己是谁  格蕾丝
Grace, is to remember what you are.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,650
你妹妹在里面生孩子
Your sister's in there giving birth.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,100
有个男人该待在这里
There's one man who should be here.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,960
你说的对  波莉  我发誓
You are right, Poll. On my oath.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,290
告诉弗莱迪来这里没事
Tell Freddie it's safe.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,870
欢迎来到这个世界  儿子
Welcome to the world, son.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,620
弗莱迪
Freddie?

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,420
波莉
Pol!

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,410
但警察把他的父亲抓走了
The police came and took his father away!

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,840
你个骗子
You liar!

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,020
丹尼尔·欧文

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,100
浴   血

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,100
黑   帮

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,100
第一季   『人人影视英剧社倾情奉献』   第五集

26
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,900
开门吧  亲爱的
Open up, love.

27
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,970
我给你和孩子带了点东西来
I brought more things for you and the baby.

28
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,630
我带了新鲜鸡蛋和面包
I've got some fresh eggs and bread...

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,590
我把东西放在门口
I'll leave it here.

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,080
艾达  多替孩子想想
Ada, think of the little one.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,740
孩子可没有原则
Babies don't have principles.

32
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,420
你跟她说话了吗
Did you speak to her?

33
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,390
她没有回应
She didn't speak back.

34
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,020
你告诉她了吗
Well, did you tell her?

35
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,380
我只会告诉她我确定的真相
I'll only tell her what I know to be true.

36
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,780
我最后再说一遍
It's the last time I am going to say this.

37
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,640
出卖弗莱迪·索恩的人不是我
It wasn't me who shopped Freddie Thorne.

38
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,490
汤米
Tommy...

39
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,990
我让你对着圣经发誓
I'd ask you to swear on the Bible,

40
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,330
但你做不到  对吗
but you can't swear on that, can you?

41
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,060
你对任何东西都毫无敬畏
Nothing you hold is sacred.

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,630
我泡了茶
There's tea.

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,080
新的运作体系
The new system...

44
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,970
所有事都记在日记里  对吗
..everything in the diary, eh?

45
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,580
一颗黑星  这是什么意思
A black star? What does that mean?

46
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,740
标上黑星那天
The black star day...

47
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,100
是我们除掉比利·肯波和他的手下的日子
..is the day we take out Billy Kimber and his men.

48
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,680
没人知道这事
No-one knows this!

49
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,200
你的家人都不知道吗
Not even your family?

50
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,810
格蕾丝
Grace...

51
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,960
我的所有家人都讨厌我
..everyone in my family hates me.

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,970
我为何还要告诉他们
Why would I tell them?

53
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,410
他彻底失控了  就是这么回事
He's off the bloody rails, is what he is.

54
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,640
如果他背叛自己最好的兄弟
If he'll turn nose on his best mate...

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,720
该死的邻居们  约翰  背后打小报告
Bloody neighbours, John. Snitch behind the curtain.

56
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,910
如果你这么想  那恐怕世上只有你一个人如此
If you think that, you're the only one who does.

57
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,260
看看这个  看看  生意很红火啊
Look at this, look. Bloody raking it in.

58
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,590
谁在管理这个马戏团
Who's running this carny?

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,700
一个叫马斯顿的人
Name of Marston.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,070
准备利用这个拳击场在小希斯度过寒冬
Intends on wintering in Smallheath with this ring.

61
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,710
-是嘛  -难道他没听说过
- Does he! - Ain't he heard

62
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,280
要想在小希斯落脚
nobody in Smallheath craps in a pot

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,020
必须经过汤米大神同意吗
without the decree of Tommy Almighty?

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,770
马斯顿先生  对吧  拳击场的老板
Mr. Marston, I believe? The ringmaster?

65
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,910
我骄傲地回答  正是在下
Proud I am to say so.

66
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,450
很好  那先来文明地谈谈
Yes, well, these here are civilised parts.

67
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,370
想要在这里做让人互相打架的生意
Man wants to set his stall up with fellas lamping each other,

68
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,370
你得先拿到许可证
he needs himself a licence.

69
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,510
许可证
A licence.

70
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,390
交钱才能拿  给管事的人
For a fee. From those in charge.

71
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,860
我看不如这样吧
I'll tell you what.

72
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,800
我留着我赚到的钱
How about I keep my money,

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,810
你把你的许可证塞回自己的屁眼里
and you shove a licence up your arsecrack?

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,670
你最好别这么跟我说话
You don't want to speak to me like that.

75
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,220
你他妈以为自己是谁啊
And who the bloody hell do you think you are?

76
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,710
我叫亚瑟·谢尔比
My name is Arthur Shelby.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,180
爸爸
Dad?

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,180
天啊
Jesus.

79
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,080
谢谢  真是个乖孩子
Thank you. You are a good boy.

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,980
多谢您  上帝
Bless you, Father,

81
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,650
感谢你赐予我们食物
for these bounties we are about to receive...

82
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,540
老天啊
Jesus Christ...

83
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,970
拜托  女人
Please, woman...

84
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,810
不要渎神
..not in vain.

85
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
吃完你的三明治就赶紧走人
Finish your sandwich and sling your hook.

86
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,450
波莉安娜
Pollyanna.

87
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,050
我是一家之主的客人
I'm the guest of the head of this family,

88
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,250
你就让我好好做客
so why don't you let me

89
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,320
自己去熨熨衣服买买菜吧
tend to your mangle or your scuttle?

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
一家之主没在家
The head of the family ain't here.

91
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,340
汤米  他有时帮我管理生意
Tommy... he sometimes helps me with business.

92
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,840
说曹操曹操到
Well. Speak of the devil.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,740
你好吗  儿子
How are you, son?

94
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,780
滚出去
Get out.

95
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,360
好啦  儿子  我已经洗心革面了
Come on, son. I'm a changed man.

96
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,050
这个家十年前需要你的时候
This family needed you ten years ago

97
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,200
你头也不回地走了
when you walked out on this.

98
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,410
现在不欢迎你  滚出这个家
Not now. Get out of this house.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,840
汤米  他已经改过了
Tommy, he's different...

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,930
你闭嘴
You shut up.

101
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,960
没事的  儿子
It's all right, son.

102
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,150
亚瑟·谢尔比不会待在不被欢迎的地方
Arthur Shelby never stays where he is not welcome.

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,630
你现在真是个人物了
Quite something you've become.

104
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,550
再见  儿子
Bye, son.

105
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,150
他是我们的爸爸
He's our dad.

106
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,890
他是个自私的混蛋
He's a selfish bastard.

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,030
你说别人是自私的混蛋
You calling someone a selfish bastard?

108
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,150
有点可笑吧  汤米
That's a bit rich, Tommy.

109
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,840
都是因为你
I mean, thanks to you...

110
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,490
我们已经失去一个妹妹了
..we're already down a bloody sister.

111
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,940
你想要见他  亚瑟
If you want to see him, Arthur?

112
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,920
你想要见他  那你跟他一起走
You want to see him? You can go with him.

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,380
格蕾丝
Grace...

114
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,090
我拿五镑的零钱  行吗
I am taking five pounds from petty cash all right?

115
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,760
那里的零钱不够五镑
We don't have five pounds in petty cash.

116
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,780
那我就有多少拿多少
Then I'll take what we've got.

117
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,830
数一下有多少  留个收据
Count it and leave a receipt.

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,840
亚瑟  有些账目我不太明白
Arthur, there are some things in the books that I don't understand.

119
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,360
-我也一样  -我们每周都给伦敦一个叫
- Likewise. - Every week we pay one pound and ten shillings

120
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,690
丹尼尔·欧文的人汇一英镑十先令过去
by postal order to a "Daniel Owen" In London.

121
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,030
高速炮弹丹尼
Danny Whizz Bang,

122
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,150
帮我们在卡姆登镇码头的酒吧里探听消息
hangs round the pubs in Camden Town Wharf for us.

123
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,070
他耳听八方
He keeps his ears open for business.

124
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,230
是个好人
He's a good man.

125
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,790
高速炮弹丹尼不是死了吗
I thought Danny Whizz Bang was dead.

126
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,720
那你就错了
Then you thought wrong, didn't you?

127
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,120
但我见过他的坟墓  他中枪而死
But I've seen his grave. He was shot.

128
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,360
那是演给意大利人看的
That was a show to satisfy the wops.

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,220
汤米开枪射出的是羊脑
Tommy just shot some sheep's brains at him.

130
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,690
那墓里葬的是谁
Who is buried in his grave?

131
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,440
格蕾丝  你要是明白事理的话
Now look, Grace, if you know what's good for you,

132
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,840
就别问与你无关的问题
you don't ask questions about things that don't concern you.

133
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,000
永远别问
Never. Right!

134
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
这钱给你
And that's for you.

135
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,550
别告诉汤米我拿了这些钱
And don't tell Tommy I took this.

136
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,700
要我说的话  那孩子需要个藏身之所
The boy needs a good hiding, if you ask me.

137
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,050
波莉阿姨也算能保护他吧
Yeah, well, Aunt Polly's close to giving him one.

138
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,650
貌似还有约翰和艾达
John and Ada too, it sounds like.

139
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,160
约翰整天都在抱怨规矩
John moans on bloody principle -

140
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,910
但要是你见过他的夫人...
but if you saw his Mrs...

141
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,620
你有女人了吗  儿子
You have a girl yourself, son?

142
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,080
得让汤米满意  是吗
P'raps when it suits Tommy, eh?

143
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,020
战后他整个人都变了
Yeah, well... He's been different, you know, since the war.

144
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,620
是啊  战争会改变一个人
Yeah, well... The war can change a man.

145
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,220
我是在说我自己
Speaking for myself, anyway.

146
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,760
你在哪打过仗  爸爸
Where did you fight, Dad?

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,380
到处都打过  儿子
All over, son, all over.

148
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,030
是啊  到处
Yeah, all over.

149
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,210
接着耶稣拯救了我
Then the salvation of Jesus Christ spread his light over me,

150
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,280
我作为朝圣者  去了新世界
and, as a pilgrim, I come to visit the New World...

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,620
美国
America.

152
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,730
在那里  我见到了未来
Where I beheld the future.

153
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,970
赌场简直是金钱工厂  儿子
Casinos! Money factories, son.

154
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,450
我一直在研究赌场
Look, I've been studying the competition,

155
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,110
他们的骗局和运营系统
their schemes, their systems.

156
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,400
-看啊  都在这里  -让我看看
- Look at that... It's all there. - Show me.

157
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,350
那行业简直是暴利
There's a fortune to be made here.

158
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,370
我已年老体衰  我的心脏就是个破旧的容器
I'm an old man, and my heart's a battered vessel.

159
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:26,560
但里面  仍搏动着梦想
But within...There still beats the fluttering pulse of a dream...

160
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,340
谢尔比赌场和酒店
The Shelby Casino and Hotel...

161
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,930
全世界的人都会蜂拥而来
Gents and dames will come flocking from all corners -

162
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,970
纽约  芝加哥  波士顿
New York, Chicago, Boston -

163
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,890
都会来到谢尔比的地盘  在那里
to The Shelby, where I can stand proudly

164
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,850
我可以与我的孩子们并肩而立
with my dear children by my side.

165
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,290
而里面的女人
And the women there!

166
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,000
如新鲜蜜桃一般
Like fresh peaches.

167
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,770
要多少有多少
Thou could have a dozen.

168
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,490
我们都会成为国王
We'd all of us be kings!

169
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,160
办赌场要多少钱
How much, how much to get started?

170
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,760
只需一点本钱  就能长成摇钱树
The oak needs but an acorn.

171
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,560
我们干吧
Let's do it.

172
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,020
开干吧
Let's do it. Let's bloody do it.

173
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,450
我也非常渴望
It would make my heart beam...

174
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,040
但我不想引起你们兄弟不和
but I don't want to cause any discord between the brothers.

175
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,960
不如你先去跟汤米谈谈
So, please, why don't you talk to Tommy first...?

176
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,070
我已经受够听他吩咐了
I'm sick of taking orders from him.

177
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,970
汤米可不是这个家族仅有的生意脑袋
Tommy's not the only one in the family with a head for business,

178
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,950
谢尔比家族的钱是大家共用的
and Shelby money is Shelby money.

179
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,580
感谢上帝给了我这么出色的儿子们
I thank God for my wonderful sons.

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,630
必须得庆祝一番
This is cause for a celebration!

181
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,860
-干杯  -干杯
- Slange. - Slange.

182
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,920
站起来  战士
On your feet, soldier!

183
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,910
站起身
On your feet.

184
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,830
爸爸  我不想跟你对打
Dad, I don't want to fight you, Dad.

185
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,190
拜托  孩子  我这年纪都能做你爸爸了
Come on, boy! I'm old enough to be thy father.

186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,480
-揍他  -对  揍他
- Hit him! Hit him! - That's it! Hit him!

187
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,690
站起来啊
On your feet.

188
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,900
快起来
Get up.

189
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,580
好吧
All right!

190
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,760
就是这样
That's it!

191
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,650
你就这点本事吗  孩子
Is that all you've got, boy?

192
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,520
站起来
Get up.

193
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,150
这位是小亚瑟·谢尔比  我儿子
This here is Arthur Shelby Junior! My son.

194
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,870
我爱他  为他骄傲
I love him, and I'm proud of him,

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,860
他能和在场随便哪个人搏斗
and he can fight any one of yous in here.

196
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,850
打得漂亮  儿子  干得好
You did good, son. You did good.

197
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,350
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, Dad. I love you.

198
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,920
是谢尔比先生吗
Mr Shelby?

199
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,830
你哪位
Who's asking?

200
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,170
我叫波恩
My name is Byrne.

201
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,540
我听你在卡姆登镇的人说你要谈判
I had word from your man in Camden Town that you wanted to parley.

202
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,920
那就谈吧
Then parley it is.

203
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,090
几个月前有个叫莱恩的人来这里
A few months ago a man named Ryan came to this place with

204
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,840
想从你那里买点好东西
a view to buying some goods from you.

205
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,040
莱恩先生遇害了  中枪而亡
Mr Ryan met with an accident. He was shot.

206
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,300
-我听说了  -他这人心直口快  我知道
- I heard... - He was a man with a quick mouth. I know that.

207
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,110
我在想他有没有在这里树敌
I wondered if he had made any enemies in here.

208
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,750
据我所知没有
None that I know of.

209
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,280
这里似乎不是树敌的地方
It's not the kind of place to make enemies.

210
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,050
这里来者便是客  波恩先生
All are welcome here, Mr Byrne...

211
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,190
包括爱尔兰人吗
Including Irish?

212
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,010
尤其是爱尔兰人
Especially Irish.

213
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,820
莱恩告诉你他是爱尔兰共和军的一员
Ryan told you he was a member of the Irish Republican Army.

214
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,650
他还是客吗
Was he still welcome?

215
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,120
正如我所说  来这里买酒喝的都是座上客
Like I say, any man that buys beer is welcome.

216
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,430
也许你不相信他
Perhaps you didn't believe him.

217
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,270
人们有时会在酒吧吐露真言
In pubs sometimes people say things

218
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,210
有时只是酒后胡言
and sometimes it's the whisky talking.

219
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,080
很难分辨二者
It's hard to tell which is which.

220
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,090
作为一个滴酒不沾的人  我觉得这点很有意思
As a teetotal man I find it amusing.

221
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,350
除非是以悲剧收场
Except when it ends in tragedy.

222
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,550
要来点加水的甜香酒吗  波恩先生
Would you like some cordial and water, Mr Byrne?

223
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,280
谢尔比先生  莱恩虽然心直口快
You see, Mr Shelby, Ryan, for all his quick mouth,

224
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,090
但却与我们...
was indeed connected.

225
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,140
我们是非常亲密的...兄弟
Very well connected...to our brotherhood.

226
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,380
既有血缘关系又是伙伴  他是我表弟
By membership and blood. He was my cousin.

227
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,120
我来自南阿玛
I am from South Armagh.

228
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,420
我在那里也算颇有影响
I am a man of influence there.

229
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,720
来点甜酒和水不错  谢尔比先生
Cordial and water would be grand, Mr Shelby.

230
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,360
格蕾丝  拿些水和甜酒到雅间来
Grace. Bring some water and cordial to the snug.

231
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,950
是  谢尔比先生
Yes, Mr Shelby.

232
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,340
我表弟来买枪
My cousin came to buy guns.

233
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,190
我告诉他我没枪
And I told him I had none.

234
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,920
你的人丹尼·欧文一喝醉就爱说话
Your man Danny Owen talks a lot when he's drunk.

235
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,590
他说剃刀党有枪
He says the Peaky Blinders do have the guns.

236
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,700
从这条路上的那家工厂抢来的
Robbed from the factory down the road.

237
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
他还吹嘘有一堆刘易斯机枪
He boasts about a stack of Lewis machine guns.

238
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,930
还有足够的子弹带  多到能给上帝当裤腰带
And enough belts of ammunition to hold up God's trousers.

239
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,800
是啊  听起来像是我们的丹尼没错
Yep. That sounds like our Danny.

240
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,810
他就爱瞎想象
He has an imagination.

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,570
如我所言  有时是威士忌起作用让人说胡话
Like I said, sometimes it's the whisky that does the talking.

242
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,220
他说只有谢尔比兄弟才知道枪存放在哪里
He says only the brothers know where the guns are kept.

243
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,350
丹尼还说过
Well, Danny also says

244
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,830
他看到德国步兵躲在运奶车后面
he sees German infantrymen on the backs of milk carts.

245
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,800
他用他的扫帚柄扫射他们
And he shoots them with his broomstick.

246
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,230
我们在伯明翰轻兵器工厂里有人
We have men in the BSA factory.

247
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
他们说枪在你手上
They say it's you who has them.

248
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,660
我们还有人在警局工作
And we have men who work in the police station.

249
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,330
每根手指  谢尔比先生  这座城里的每根手指
Every finger, Mr Shelby, every finger in this city,

250
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,200
都指向同一方向
points in one direction.

251
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,370
请别把我当傻子
Please don't mistake me for a fool.

252
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,720
我直说了吧
Let me get to the point.

253
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,860
我不管你在这里乱搞什么
I don't care what kind of half-arsed tinker operation

254
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,140
该死的吉普赛勾当
you have going here.

255
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,390
但我可以跟你保证
But I can assure you,

256
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,300
我代表一个十分特殊的组织
I represent a very different category of organization.

257
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,820
我表弟被枪击
My cousin was shot.

258
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,290
我是法官  陪审团和行刑者
I am judge, jury and executioner.

259
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,890
我认为你有罪  就由我下判决
I find you guilty and I pass sentence.

260
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,120
你把枪送来给我
You deliver the guns to me

261
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,030
否则我就把你和你那帮暴徒
or I deliver death and hell's fury

262
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,060
送到十八层地狱去
to you and your little tribe of heathens.

263
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,320
我说得够清楚了吗
Am I making myself clear?

264
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,930
我要跟你坦白一些事
Let me confess something to you.

265
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,780
只跟你坦白
And only to you.

266
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,500
枪在我手里
I have the guns...

267
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,490
但对我而言已成负担了
..But they have become a burden to me.

268
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,890
也许现在是时候卸掉负担了
Perhaps it is time to unload that burden.

269
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,500
卖个好价钱
For the right price.

270
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,530
马拉奇·波恩
Malachi Byrne.

271
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,670
南阿玛爱尔兰共和军的旅长
Brigade commander of the South Armagh IRA.

272
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,930
你这回可钓上条大鱼了
You've hooked yourself a big fish there.

273
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,750
拿枪做诱饵  谁知道我们还能钓上什么来
With these guns as bait who knows what we'll catch?

274
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,850
我们
'We'?

275
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,050
你是在提议你我携手合作吗
Are you suggesting that you and I could work together as a team?

276
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,030
也许我们的共同点比你想象的多  督察
Perhaps we have more in common than you think, Inspector.

277
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,210
你能活捉他送过来吗
Can you deliver him?

278
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,750
有你相助就行
With your help.

279
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,790
我要你去爱尔兰放出消息  说与我无关
And I want word put out in Ireland that I was not involved.

280
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,010
我还得为你解决问题
So, I would be solving a problem for you.

281
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,280
而我会为你赢得那枚勋章
And I would be winning you that medal.

282
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,680
如果我得到一枚勋章
If I get a medal

283
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,360
我会把你的姓名首字母刻在后面
I will have your initials engraved on the backside.

284
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,350
我的姓名首字母刻在你屁股后面
My initials on your backside.

285
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,710
那真是让人想入非非的画面
Now, that's quite an image.

286
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,350
督察  既然我们相处得这么好
Inspector, since we are getting along so well,

287
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,520
你能回答我一个问题吗
can you answer me a question?

288
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,830
是谁告诉你弗莱迪·索恩的行踪
Who gave you Freddie Thorne?

289
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,240
城里每个人都知道
As everyone in the city knows.

290
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,990
正是你  谢尔比先生
It was you, Mr Shelby.

291
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,240
你好啊  儿子
Hello, son.

292
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,050
都在这儿了
It's all there.

293
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,940
是啊
It is indeed.

294
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,920
我们要拿这笔钱干一番事业  儿子
We're going to build something with this, son.

295
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,850
伟大的事业
Something magnificent.

296
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,240
我们什么时候出发  老爸
When do we sail, Dad?

297
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,250
-渴望开工了  是吗  -对啊
- Hungry for work, are you? - Yeah.

298
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,060
这周五有艘船要出海  拳击台见
A ship sails Friday. Meet me at the boxing ring.

299
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,950
好  周五
Right. Friday.

300
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,880
周五
Friday.

301
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,510
门留着别关
Leave that open.

302
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,840
不用了
No.

303
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,240
-你预感麻烦要找上门来了吗  -对
- Are you expecting trouble? - Yeah.

304
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,850
-在这个点吗  -半夜跟其他时候没两样
- At this hour? - Midnight is as good an hour as any.

305
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,160
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

306
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,800
圣安德鲁的钟声在半夜敲响时
When the St Andrew's bell strikes midnight,

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,540
两名爱尔兰共和军成员将穿过那道门
two IRA men are going to come through that door.

308
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,730
等他们获得他们想要的东西后  就会动手杀我
When they have what they want, they plan to kill me.

309
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,180
你的任务就是阻止那一切
It's your job to stop that happening.

310
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,520
你可以早些给我警告的
You could have given me some warning.

311
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,170
我也是才得到消息的
I just got the message myself.

312
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,160
他们想在这里单独见我
They want to meet me here alone.

313
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,940
酒吧女招待不算人吗  
And barmaids don't count?

314
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,620
不算  酒吧女招待不算
No. Barmaids don't count.

315
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,140
你得去密室待会儿
Now, you're going to be in the back room.

316
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,730
我要坐在那里
I am going to be sitting there.

317
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,260
等我开始祝酒时
When I make a toast,

318
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,890
你就举着那玩意儿出来
you're going to come out with that thing raised.

319
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,780
你别开枪  指着就行  剩下的我来
You don't shoot, you just point, I'll do the rest.

320
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,960
你会杀了他们吗
Will you kill them?

321
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,070
-不会  警察要活的  -警察也知道这事吗
- No, the police want them alive... - The police know about this?

322
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,570
听着  你把枪举起来
Look, you just hold it up

323
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,650
指着就行  好吗
and you just point. Right?

324
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,120
好了  快快快  快  走吧
Right, go, go. Go on, go.

325
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,990
我们就躲在这儿
We'll hold back here.

326
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,610
无论哪一方受伤  都与我们无关
If damage is done to either side, it's no concern of ours.

327
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,460
你们不渴了吗
Lost your thirst, eh?

328
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,770
给我们看看在哪儿
Just show us where.

329
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,810
给我现金
Give me the cash.

330
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,500
你们需要一把铲子
You're going to need a shovel.

331
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,910
你个该死的笨吉普赛人
You thick fucking tinker.

332
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,990
你以为我们会让你活命吗
Did you think we'd let you live?

333
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,050
进行最后的忏悔吧  谢尔比先生
Make your peace, Mr Shelby.

334
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,420
我会以我自己的方式忏悔
I will make my peace my own way.

335
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,390
敬不算在内的酒吧女招待
To barmaids who don't count...

336
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,420
你为什么要开枪
Why did you shoot?

337
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:11,390
你为什么要开枪  格蕾丝
Why did you shoot, Grace?

338
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,180
我不知道我有那样可怕的心理
I didn't know I had it in me like that.

339
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,550
现在你看到我的真实面目了
So, now you've seen me.

340
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,980
你也看到了真实的我
And you've seen me...

341
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,130
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

342
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,990
你们本该在时钟敲响第六下时就赶到
You were supposed to come on the sixth chime.

343
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,330
你们本该在他妈的第六声钟响就赶到的
You were supposed to come on the fucking sixth chime.

344
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,490
他们不肯投降
They refused to surrender.

345
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,690
他们擅长战斗  他们很勇敢
They fought well. They were brave men.

346
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,630
他看起来像是被某个凶猛的野兽咬死的
Well, he looks like he was killed by a wild fucking animal.

347
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,710
不过
Still...

348
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,710
就当这一切都没发生  他们从没来过这里
This never happened and they were never here,

349
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,760
谁在意是怎么死的呢
who cares?

350
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,770
你能把这些尸体弄出去吗
Will you get the bodies out of here?

351
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,080
他们让这位女士反胃了吗
All right, are they...? Are they making the lady uncomfortable?

352
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,560
我就不打扰你们这对小情人了  好吗
I'll leave you two love birds to it then, eh?

353
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

354
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,550
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,680
首先我要澄清  我不知道
First of all, let me say I had no idea

356
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,560
他会让你卷入这宗丑陋的交易中
he would involve you in this ugly business.

357
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,720
我要是早知道  绝不会坐视不管
If I had, I never would have let it happen.

358
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,840
他信任我  我告诉过你
He trusts me. I told you that.

359
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,460
你不相信我
You didn't believe me.

360
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,730
莫斯警长提交了案件报告
Sergeant Moss made a report.

361
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,570
当然  我已经烧掉了
Which, of course, I have burnt.

362
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,810
他说当他进去时  你们正抱在一起
He said that when he entered the room, you were embracing.

363
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,530
那是你关注的要点吗  一个拥抱
Is that your primary concern? An embrace?

364
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,200
我  我关心的是你的利益
My...my concern is your welfare.

365
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,150
是我杀的他们
It was me who killed them.

366
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,950
我失控了
I had no control.

367
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,890
你和一群暴徒生活在一起
You have been living with beasts.

368
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,670
试图阻止我的人正是那个暴徒
It was the beast that tried to stop me.

369
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,990
我相信昨晚改变了我内心的某些想法
I believe last night something inside me changed.

370
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,490
我不再想为父亲报仇了
I no longer feel the need to avenge my father.

371
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,700
促使我来到这里的怨恨烟消云散
The hatred that I brought with me here has gone.

372
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,250
于是我接受这项任务的初衷也不存在了
And therefore my reasons for joining the service.

373
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,800
你想辞职吗
You want to resign?

374
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,010
我想我们的任务已经结束了
I think our mission has come to a natural end.

375
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,710
我想我知道枪藏在哪里了
I think I know where the guns are hidden.

376
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,150
你知道了  那么  告诉我在哪里
You do? So? Tell me where.

377
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,450
如果我是对的  枪找到了
If I am right, and the guns are found,

378
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,630
你与汤玛斯·谢尔比再无瓜葛
you will have no more business with Thomas Shelby.

379
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,550
不是吗  我们的军事任务也完成了
Is that not so? Our military mission will be over.

380
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,120
我们怎么来的就怎么走
And we can leave the city as we found it.

381
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,030
你是在试图  和我做交易码
Are you trying to... do a deal with me?

382
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,410
如果是的话  你就得说明白点
Because if you are, you must be explicit.

383
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,270
我要你保证  如果枪找到了
I want your word that Thomas Shelby will not be harmed

384
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,930
你不能伤害汤玛斯·谢尔比
if the guns are recovered.

385
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,900
君子一言  驷马难追
Your word as a gentleman.

386
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,650
怎么样
Will you give it?

387
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,140
你  为什么想救他
Why...would you want to save him?

388
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,990
残留的同情心
A residue of sympathy.

389
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,280
同情心  你是说感情
Sympathy? You mean sentiment?

390
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,870
是的
Yes.

391
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,690
他以他的方式  对我很好
In his way, he has been kind to me.

392
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,810
感情
Sentiment.

393
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,160
没错
Yes.

394
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,040
你太善良了不适合这份工作
You are too good-hearted for this work.

395
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,470
也许吧
Perhaps.

396
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,500
所以为了我  你能放过他吗
So, for my sake, will you spare him?

397
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,120
我向你保证
You have my word.

398
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,170
在盗窃案发生一周后
A week after the robbery

399
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,000
圣安德鲁斯墓地有一场葬礼
there was a burial at St Andrews' churchyard.

400
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,830
我发现那个本该被安葬的人还活着
I have found out the man supposed to be buried is alive.

401
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,490
亚瑟心里藏不住事
Arthur is quite transparent.

402
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,540
我得知那场葬礼只有谢尔比家的兄弟们参加
I learned that the funeral was attended only by the brothers.

403
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,610
那个墓穴挖的远比正常情况深得多
And the grave that was dug was far deeper than your average

404
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,550
内部还含有铅
and was lined with lead...

405
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,790
为了保持干燥
To keep out the damp.

406
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,660
枪就被埋在那个墓穴中
The guns are buried in that grave.

407
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,130
那么  今晚我们去掘墓
Then, tonight, we will dig up the grave.

408
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:06,390
*当家人以为我安全入睡时*
*When my family thinks that I'm safely in my bed*

409
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,220
*从黎明直至黑夜*
*Oh, from morn until night*

410
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,280
*我倚着你的头*
*I am stretched out at your head*

411
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,150
*在六尺之下呼唤我*
*Calling out unto the earth*

412
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,950
*带着激动狂热的泪水*
*With tears hot and wild*

413
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,930
*为那个男孩的逝去*
*For the loss of a boy*

414
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,950
*从孩提时代起我挚爱的男孩*
*That I loved as a child*

415
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,090
乖  乖乖快点睡觉吧
Please, please go to sleep.

416
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,510
*我躺在你的坟墓上*
*So, I am stretched on your grave*

417
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,350
*永远躺在这里*
*And I'll lie here for ever*

418
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,790
*执子之手*
*If your hands were in mine*

419
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,710
*永不分离*
*I'd be sure they would not sever*

420
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,890
*我的苹果树  我的光明*
*My apple tree, my brightness*

421
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,780
*是时候在一起了*
*It's time we were together...*

422
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,710
干得漂亮  小伙子们
Well done, boys!

423
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:05,010
*我带着泥土的芳香*
*For I smell of the earth*

424
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,850
*我穿着当季的衣裳*
*And I'm worn by the weather *

425
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,200
除了一把枪不在  其余的都找到了
All, but one gun accounted for.

426
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,430
长官  我请求辞职
Then, Sir, I resign my commission.

427
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,510
好
Good.

428
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,450
那么  我不再是你的上司
So, I am no longer your superior officer

429
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,800
你也不再是我的下属了
and you are no longer my subordinate.

430
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:52,330
既然如此
And therefore...

431
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,310
法规允许我
Regulations permit me...

432
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,930
送给你这个
to offer you this.

433
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,260
我  我是个简单的好人
I am...I am a simple man, but a good man.

434
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,480
我对你的欣赏
And my admiration for you...

435
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,290
转化成为爱
Has turned to love.

436
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,880
我不是恳求你也爱我  只是
I don't ask for love in return. Just...

437
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,940
鉴于我们志趣相投
Recognition that we are like minds...

438
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,810
有共同的价值观
With shared values.

439
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,630
格蕾丝
Grace...

440
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,980
你愿意嫁给我吗
Will you marry me?

441
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,130
坎贝尔先生
Mr Campbell...

442
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,020
你值得拥有更好的人
You deserve better.

443
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,560
你不答应是因为他吗
Is it him between us?

444
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,250
那个掘墓之徒  是他吗
Is it the beast that dug that grave? Is it him?

445
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,700
我明早递交辞呈
My resignation will be with you in the morning...

446
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,650
爸
Dad!

447
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,640
你好儿子  谁告诉你我在这里的
Hullo, son. May I ask who gave my whereabouts?

448
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,960
马斯顿
Marston.

449
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,940
他说你昨晚付完嫖资就离开了
Said you left him last night with a bill for your whores.

450
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,050
好吧  至少我们能道别  儿子
Well, at least we got to say goodbye, son.

451
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,780
替我向你亲爱的兄弟们说声再见  好吗
And bid a fond adieu to your dear brothers, would you?

452
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,770
你怎能这样对我们
How could you do this to us?

453
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,100
哪样  儿子
Do what, son?

454
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,830
你说的那些话  谢尔比赌场
All that stuff you said about...the Shelby Casino...

455
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,130
大西洋城
..and Atlantic City.

456
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,620
说实话
Well, if the truth be told,

457
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,660
我并没去过美国
I've not been so acquainted with that promised land

458
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,870
我全是骗你的
as I had thee believe.

459
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,180
你是个他妈的骗子和盗贼
You're a fucking liar and a thief.

460
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,100
把我的钱还我
You give me back my fucking money.

461
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,090
"盗若因饿  窃物充饥
"Do not despise the thief, if he steals to

462
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,800
人之不鄙"
"satisfy his starvation"

463
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,970
这是《圣经》箴言  儿子
That's in the Holy Bible, son.

464
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,130
我已经饿太久了
And I've starved for so very long.

465
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,960
再见了  儿子
Fare thee well, son.

466
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,400
我等你了
I waited for you.

467
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,830
我等了
I waited.

468
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,550
听着  小子  这里不是拳击场
Listen to me, boy. You are not in the prize ring now.

469
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,830
你再敢动我一根毫毛
If you ever put your hands on me again,

470
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,950
我会割了你的喉咙  把你丢到铁轨上
I'll cut your fucking throat and spread you on these tracks.

471
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,130
你父亲呢
Where's your father?

472
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,980
我猜他正用那双玩弄妓女的脏手
I'm assuming he's busy frittering the 500 you took from us

473
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,820
挥霍你从我们家偷拿的五百英镑
and put in his thieving, whore-groping hands.

474
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,690
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

475
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,590
做这种事前
How dare you do something

476
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,460
为什么不跟汤玛斯和我商量
like that without talking to Thomas or me?

477
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,540
汤米知道了吗
Does Tommy know?

478
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,890
不知道  但你得告诉他
No. But you're going to tell him.

479
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,630
伟大的胜利值得庆祝
You might take satisfaction in a great victory.

480
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,480
可怕的后果得以避免
A terrible consequence has been avoided.

481
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,020
我们挖出来的那些枪
'Those guns that we dug up

482
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,140
永远不会被用于谋杀无辜
will never be used to murder the innocent

483
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,090
或颠覆政府
'or usurp the status quo.

484
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,380
但是  尽管我们阻止了犯罪
'But, even though we have solved a crime,

485
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,820
但却没能将凶手绳之于法
'we have as yet failed to punish the criminal.'

486
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,410
挖坟埋枪的人
This man who dug that grave

487
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,230
也给自己掘下坟墓
has also dug his own.

488
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,910
事实证明  他对国家是一个致命的威胁
He has proved a deadly menace to the King's peace.

489
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,050
今晚我们将击溃他
'And tonight we will strike him down.

490
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,280
我们将用剑直刺他的黑心
'We will drive our swords through his black heart,

491
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,590
我们将端掉他肮脏的鼠窝
'we will pursue him into the rat holes that he infests.'

492
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,960
最终
And, finally,

493
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,680
我们要让他和同党在城中消失
we will rid this city of his kind.

494
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,800
正义必将伸张  我们绝不放弃
Justice will be done and will be seen to be done.

495
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,690
阿门
Amen.

496
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,120
今后我们会有麻烦  芬恩
There's going to be trouble now, Finn.

497
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,650
你照顾好自己  听到了吗
You look after yourself, do you hear me?

498
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,580
我会离开一段时间  好的  走吧
I'm going to be going away for a while. Right... Go on.

499
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,540
喂  谁他妈想打一架
Right... Who wants to fucking fight?

500
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,250
拳击赛结束了  我们要关门离开了
Fighting's over. We're closing up and moving on.

501
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,850
我问谁他妈想打架
I said who wants to fucking fight?

502
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:01,620
老子是他妈的亚瑟·谢尔比
My name is Arthur fucking Shelby!

503
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,870
谁敢跟我打
Who dares to fight me?!

504
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,560
回家吧伙计  小心被揍
Go home, lad. Before you catch yourself a spanking.

505
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,180
我在迪格巴思的兄弟说从达林顿
My brother in Digbeth just says the police are coming down

506
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,370
来了大批警察
from Deritend in numbers.

507
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,770
到处寻找汤米·谢尔比
Asking for Tommy Shelby by name.

508
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,800
见鬼
Shit.

509
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,980
-我得避避风头  -为什么
- I'm going to have to lie low for a while. - Why?

510
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,580
我没筹码了
I lost my bargaining power.

511
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,130
那个警察  现在我和他只有一个人能活命
This copper, it's just me and him now.

512
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,040
我回来后
When I get back...

513
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,320
我要告诉你一些事
..I'll tell you some things.

514
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,770
哈里说警察已经到迪格巴思了
Harry said the police are already in Digbeth.

515
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,380
-是的  -你为什么冒险来这里
- Yeah. - You took a chance coming here, why?

516
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,840
警察进巷子了  汤米
The police are in the lane, Tommy.

517
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,770
跟我走
Come with me.

518
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,140
我在找汤玛斯·谢尔比
I'm looking for Thomas Shelby.

519
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,680
没听说过这人
Never heard of him.

520
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,840
你永远别想找到他
You'll never find him.

521
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,430
回家去
Go home.

522
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,430
也许我该再问一遍
Perhaps I should ask the question again.

523
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,000
跪下
On your knees.

524
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,300
现在  听清楚了  酒保
Now, understand this, barman.

525
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,200
我不关心你的死活
I don't care if you live or die.

526
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,680
我真不知道
I don't know.

527
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,620
他离开了
He left...

528
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,320
跟酒吧女侍一起
..with the barmaid.

529
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,380
他和格蕾丝走了
He left with Grace.

530
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,480
我觉得他们去她家了
I think they were going to her place.

531
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,660
取消行动
Call it off.

532
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,480
我不明白  长官  我们应该去找酒吧女侍...
I don't understand, sir. We should find the barmaid...

533
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,180
全部取消
Call it all off!

534
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,670
都取消
All of it!

535
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,520
上车
Get in.

536
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,690
比较简陋
It's not much of a place.

537
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,750
挺好的
It's all right.

538
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,850
喝茶吗
You want tea?

539
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,630
不了
Tea? No.

540
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,280
我有朗姆酒
I have rum...

541
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,370
我还是喝茶吧
Actually, tea it is.

542
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,830
你想让我刮目相看
You want to impress me?

543
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,590
是的  你有饼干吗
Yes. And do you have a biscuit?

544
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,780
没有  饼干引老鼠
No. They attract mice.

545
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,200
人一回家感觉就不一样了
People look different at home.

546
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,790
怎么不一样
In what way?

547
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,080
卸下警惕
Off guard.

548
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,500
我应该警惕吗
Should I be on my guard?

549
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,810
不用  我只是个喝茶的男人
No, I'm a man who drinks tea.
