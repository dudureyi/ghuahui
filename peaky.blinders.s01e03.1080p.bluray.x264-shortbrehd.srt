没人可以跟我合作

我们哪儿都不去  艾达

我们就在这儿结婚  带着我们的孩子

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,880
我不怕汤米·谢尔比
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,230
汤玛斯

17
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,420
你敢把枪卖给任何一个能发挥其用武之地的人

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,550
你就死定了

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,820
把它们扔到警察能找到的地方

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,550
汤玛斯·谢尔比现在是

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,060
你任务的全部内容

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,370
我该做什么
So what shall I do?

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,850
你必须不择手段地接近他

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,780
找件漂亮的礼服

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,410
我带你去赛马会

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,130
但我想提醒你  我会让你心碎的
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,410
我心已碎
Already broken.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,640
给我一瓶威士忌和三个杯子

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,460

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,830
我决定不去了

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,850
那个赛马会
To the races.

33
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,430
除非你再加两英镑

34

十先令来付礼服钱

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,720
我已经给过你三英镑了
I've already given you three.

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,070
你到时候穿的西装会值多少钱
How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?

37
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,910
我不会花钱买西装
Oh, I don't pay for suits.

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,280
我的西装都是店家赠送的
My suits are on the house

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,780
不然我就烧了他的铺子
or the house burns down.

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,620
你想让我穿得跟卖花女一样吗
So you want me to go looking like a flower girl?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,350
我怎么想都无所谓
What I want makes no difference.

42
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,950
你穿着打扮可不是为了我
It's not me you're dressing up for.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,690
浴   血

44
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,690
黑   帮

45
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,690
第一季   『人人影视英剧社倾情奉献』   第三集

谢尔比先生  如果我太迷恋这酒  你可得见谅
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby, if I indulge a little.

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,920
请自便
Please.

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,310
一个来自史巴伯洛克区的人
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook

49
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,110
想走进这酒吧可需要不少勇气
to step inside this pub.

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,770
任何有钱  无意捣乱的人
Anyone with money and good intentions

51
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,250
在加里森酒吧都会受到欢迎的
is welcome in the Garrison.

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,770
你之前说有正事要谈
Now...you said you had business.

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,550
那事不能明说  谢尔比先生
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.

54
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,140
是关于某人知道某事的相关情况的问题
It's a question of who knows what about what.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,700
跟不远处的伯明翰轻兵器工厂有关
It concerns the factory down the road, at the BSA.

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,970
你或许也知道
As you might know,

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,940
那边大多数油漆车间里面都是爱尔兰人
most of the paint shop there is Irish.

58
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,560
像那种大地方  谣言很容易传播的

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,720
什么东西被盗了

61
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,730
枪支  谢尔比先生  大量的枪支
Guns, Mr Shelby. A serious amount of guns.

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,400
那跟我有什么关系
What business is that of mine?

63
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,260
在推测方面
When it comes to speculation,

64
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,530
谁也比不上工厂的夜班工人
you can't beat a factory night shift.

65
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,790
有些人说  打样车间有小道消息流传
Some say there was word from the proofing bay

66
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,620
说那些枪是被剃刀党的人劫走了
it was the Peaky Blinders who took them.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,340
你那些夜班工人一定是在做梦
Your night shift must be dreaming.

68
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,130
-或许是的  -或许也不是
- Maybe they are. - Maybe they're not.

69
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,670
我们想说的是  谢尔比先生
What we are trying to say is, Mr Shelby,

70
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,630
如果你耳闻了我们刚说的那东西的下落
that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items...

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,130
我们愿意出大价钱
We'd pay good money.

72
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,000
你们有很多钱吗
You have good money?

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,830
我们有从酒吧征集的捐款
We have collections from the pubs.

74
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,280
你们是代表谁在谈
For who do you speak?

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,490
-爱尔兰人民  -爱尔兰共和军
- The people of Ireland. - The Irish Republican Army.

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,970
-当真吗  -绝逼当真
- For a fact? - For a fucking fact.

77
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,570
你以为我们是在开玩笑吗
You think we're jokers?

78
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,210
我难道笑了吗
Am I laughing?

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,520
*父亲啊父亲  你为何如此悲伤*
*Oh, father, why are you so sad*

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,080
*在这晴朗的复活节清晨*
*On this bright Easter morn'... *

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,610
麦格瑞  你能闭嘴吗
Maguire, will you shut up?

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,340
*爱尔兰人何时才能*
*When Irishmen are proud and glad*

83
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,370
*为生他养他的祖国感到骄傲*
*Of the land where they were born? *

84
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,040
麦格瑞  你个该死的  我们要谈正经事呢
Maguire, away and shite man, we're trying to talk business...

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,990
*儿子啊儿子  我突然想起*
*Oh, son, I see sad mem'ries view*

86
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,560
*过去的痛苦回忆*
*Of far-off distant days

87
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,560
*当我和你一样还是个孩子时*
*When being just a boy like you*

88
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,950
*我加入了爱尔兰共和军*
*I joined the IRA.*

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,490
太精彩了
Bravo!

90
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,130
好了  够了
All right, boys.

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,270
如果我听到关于那事的什么消息
If I hear anything about who knows what about what,

92
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,900
我会通知你的
I'll let you know.

93
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,430
*我的宝贝啊  我好想再见到*
*Gra mo chree, I long to see*

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,640
*共和军的那些战士*
*The boys of the old IRA... *

95
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,870
我以为你只允许周六那天唱歌呢
I thought you only allowed singing on a Saturday.

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,850
威士忌有很好的验证作用
Whiskey is good proofing water.

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,930
能够告诉你谁是真的  谁是假的
It tells you who's real and who isn't.

98
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,730
我的那些同胞们想要什么
And what did my countrymen want?

99
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,170
他们只是无名小卒罢了
They're nobodies.

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,270
他们通常在史巴伯洛克区的黑天鹅酒吧混
They drink in The Black Swan in Sparkbrook.

101
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,790
他们成为叛军  只是因为喜欢那些歌罢了
They're only rebels because they like the songs.

102
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,280
你同情他们吗
You have sympathies with them?

103
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,470
我对任何人东西都没有同情
I have no sympathies of any description.

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,590
他们的口音好重
Their accents were so thick,

105
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,260
不知道你能不能听得懂
it's a wonder you could understand them.

106
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,430
下次的话  我可以帮忙翻译
Next time, I could translate.

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,100
你愿意替我做事吗
You'd work for me?

108
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,740
我以为我已经在替你做事了呢  
I thought I already was.

109
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,130
所以你愿意去参加赛马会
So you are coming to the races?

110
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,970
两英镑  十先令

111
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,290
十先令
Ten shillings.

112
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,070
买件红色的衣服
Buy something red.

113
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,980
和他的手帕搭配
To match his handkerchief.

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,450
谁的手帕
Whose handkerchief?

115
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
艾达  你搞什么啊
Ada, what the hell?

116
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,410
我鼓足勇气穿着婚纱跑过他们的势力范围
I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,270
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

118
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,460
是啊  气得要疯了
Yeah. Mad as hell with all of them.

119
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,550
我爱你
I love you.

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,510
我也爱你
I love you too.

121
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,050
他们越是想阻碍我们  我就会越疯狂
The more they try to stop us, the madder I'll be.

122
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,200
-来吧小公主  牧师在等着了  -等等
- Come on, princess, the vicar's waiting. - Wait...

123
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,950
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

124
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,530
宛若天使
Like an angel.

125
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,150
莫斯
Moss?

126
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,160
我们掌握了关于黑天鹅酒吧的什么信息吗
What do we know about The Black Swan?

127
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,890
有个卧底提供情报说
An operative has provided intelligence

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,730
那里是爱尔兰共和军的聚集地
that it is a place where IRA men gather.

129
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,320
就是些醉醺醺的船员在那儿唱歌而已  长官
It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.

130
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,030
爱尔兰共和军才不会去那种地方
The IRA wouldn't go near them.

131
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,060
那那里怎么会有两个人要买枪呢
Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?

132
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,800
那两人叫什么
Do you have names?

133
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,640
什么事都要她帮你打点好吗
Must she do everything for you?

134
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,250
"她"  长官
"She", sir?

135
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,960
事实证明  一个女卧底
One female operative has proved more useful

136
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,340
比你们这些壮汉都有用
than any of you great lumps of men.

137
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,830
我们是正规警察  长官  不是间谍
We are regular police officers, sir. Not spies.

138
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,270
只有发生了罪案  我们才能行动
We can only act when a crime has been committed.

139
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,580
也许我该派些人
Perhaps I should send some men

140
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,170
去黑天鹅酒吧查问一下
down to The Black Swan to ask questions.

141
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,210
然后打草惊蛇吗
And scare them all into hiding?

142
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,720
并非上策  警长
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.

143
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,070
我的策略源自我在法国的经历
My tactics come from my experiences in France.

144
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,320
我那些大块头手下大多也在法国服过役  长官
Most of my great lumps of men served in France too, sir.

145
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,290
我每天都为国鞠躬尽瘁
I serve my country every day.

146
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,190
没其它事了  警长
That will be all, Sergeant.

147
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,490
滚远点
Away and shite!

148
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,060
爱上我了是吗
Fancy me, do ya?

149
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,370
你是什么人  警察吗
What are you? A copper?

150
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,610
臭婊子
Proddy bitch!

151
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,550
我见过你  你是加里森酒吧的侍应生
I've seen you. I've seen your face, serving in the Garrison.

152
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,600
过来
Come here...

153
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,690
我要代表爱尔兰自由邦
I am taking you in for interrogation

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,070
把你带回去审问
on behalf of the Irish Free State.

155
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,300
行了吧
All right?

156
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,650
你带武器了吗
Are you armed?

157
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,910
没有
No.

158
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,130
那我就告诉你
Then I'll tell you.

159
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,830
艾达和弗莱迪·索恩今天结婚了
Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.

160
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,330
他们没听你的  留在了这里
They defied your orders, they haven't left the city.

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,010
我会处理的
I'll deal with it.

162
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,260
汤玛斯  让我来处理
Thomas...I'll deal with it.

163
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,480
他们在哪
Where are they?

164
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,630
弗莱迪的同志提供的安全屋  
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.

165
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,420
你为何打听这个
Why do you want to know?

166
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,770
我想送些花过去  不然呢
I want to send them flowers. Why do you think?

167
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,850
他们留下来有那么糟吗
Would it be so bad if they stayed?

168
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,800
我保证会让弗莱迪离开的
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.

169
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,360
向谁保证
Promised who?

170
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,950
我跟警察说弗莱迪不会再回来
I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.

171
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,920
那是协议的一部分
It's part of the deal.

172
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,450
什么狗日的协议
What bloody deal?

173
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,400
怎么没有家族表决  召开会议
What happened to family votes? What happened to meetings?

174
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,170
要是你把艾达和弗莱迪的事交给我处理
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie,

175
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,490
大家都能相安无事
it'll end in peace.

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,310
你已经饱受战争之苦
Christ knows you've had your fill of war.

177
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,900
一定要让弗莱迪离开这里  波莉
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.

178
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,360
不然我就亲自处理
Or else I'll deal with it myself.

179
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,380
死者在黑天鹅酒吧喝过酒  长官
The victim had been drinking in The Black Swan pub, sir -

180
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,280
就是您提过的那个酒吧
the pub you told me about.

181
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,000
邻里说见到一名年轻女子
And a neighbour said she saw a young woman

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,260
离开陈尸现场所在的那条街
leaving the street where the body was found.

183
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,020
一个女人  长官  我在想其中是否有联系
A woman, sir. I was wondering if there was a connection.

184
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,780
什么联系  警长
A connection with what, Sergeant?

185
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,040
您说那位间谍是女人  长官
You said your spy was a woman, sir.

186
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,880
我在想现在针对那些人是不是定了决策
I wondered if now there was now a policy.

187
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,600
格杀勿论  和贝尔法斯特一样
Shoot to kill. Like there was in Belfast.

188
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,320
爱尔兰共和军内部派系众多
The Republicans are famously factional.

189
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,540
他是死于自己人之手
He was killed by one of his own.

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,460
就是这样  警长
That will be all, Sergeant.

191
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,030
他们不叫间谍
And they're not called spies.

192
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,930
叫卧底探员
They're called operatives.

193
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,750
是  长官  卧底探员
Operatives, sir. Right, sir.

194
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,580
-你就这样说话  -是啊
- It's how you say things.  - Yeah.

195
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,760
她来这里干什么
What the bloody hell is she doing here?

196
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,550
200英镑  弗莱迪
200 pounds, Freddie.

197
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,020
干什么
For what?

198
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,540
让我们去度一个永不结束的蜜月
For us. For a honeymoon that goes on for ever.

199
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,080
-哪来的钱  -家庭基金
- Where did it come from? - Family fund.

200
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,880
寡妇和绝望的男人兜里的钱
The pockets of widows and desperate men.

201
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,640
理智一点  弗莱迪
See sense, Freddie.

202
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,730
汤米不会放过你们的
Tommy is not going to let this rest.

203
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,900
这年头  家里有个共产主义分子会影响生意
Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business.

204
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,290
你必须离开这里
You have to leave the city.

205
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,270
-你认为我对付不了汤米·谢尔比  -没错
- You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby? - You can't.

206
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,370
我现在都觉得掌控不了他  
I'm having trouble these days

207
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,920
而你还不如我够爷们儿
and I'm twice the man you are.

208
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,240
我去了一趟镇上
I went into town.

209
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,920
库纳德邮轮公司
The Cunard office.

210
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,640
我给你们定了下一班
I booked you both tickets on the next boat

211
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,260
从利物浦去纽约的船票
from Liverpool to New York.

212
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,660
美国啊  弗莱迪
America, Freddie.

213
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,960
他们已经革命过了
They've already had their revolution.

214
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,190
你就不用操心了
You won't have to bother.

215
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,820
两位女士至少得让我考虑一下吧
Will you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?

216
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,460
你无权那么做的
You had no business...

217
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,820
观察和上报  那是你的任务
Observe and report. That is your remit.

218
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,160
我认为有必要知道他的住处
I decided we needed to know where he lived.

219
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,600
我警告过你别让私人情绪
I warned you not to let your personal history

220
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,040
影响判断
cloud your judgment.

221
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,090
你因为他是爱尔兰共和军才跟踪他
You went after him because he was IRA.

222
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,790
我跟着他是因为我以为他身上有情报
I followed him because I thought he might have information.

223
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
根据规定
According to the rules,

224
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,510
我应该立即将你撤出加里森街
I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately.

225
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,360
不要  切尔滕纳姆赛马就是明天了
No. Cheltenham is tomorrow.

226
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,110
你负担太重了
You take too much upon yourself.

227
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,600
是你说这是现行军事行动
This is an active military mission - your words.

228
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,380
我只是履行职责
I'm doing my job.

229
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,900
格蕾丝  我才不在乎一个芬尼亚会小喽啰的死
Grace, the death of a base Fenian doesn't concern me.

230
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,760
我在乎的是你
Your welfare does.

231
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,270
杀人会让心里蒙上阴影
Killing a man affects the heart.

232
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,100
至于我的心...
And as for my heart...

233
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
我知道因为我们两家的关系
I know that because of our family connections,

234
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,340
你私心上会特别关照我
you take my progress personally.

235
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,470
可我不需要你来扮演我父亲的角色
But I don't need you to be my father.

236
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,600
我会想着你的
I will be thinking of you.

237
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,750
-谢尔比先生  -张先生
- Mr Shelby, sir. - Mr Zhang.

238
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,290
那套西装已经卖出去了  先生  今早定下的
That suit is sold, sir. It's being collected this morning.

239
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,840
肯波

240
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,780
我知道
I know.

241
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,610
求你们了  先生们  别在这里打架闹事
Please, gentlemen. No fighting in here.

242
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,470
没事  我们是朋友
It's all right. I come as a friend.

243
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,520
你在为切尔滕纳姆的行程挑选衣服啊
You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham -

244
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
很好看
it's very nice.

245
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
你他妈是怎么知道的
How the bloody hell do you know?

246
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,730
我知道很多事  肯波先生
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.

247
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,640
就像我之前和你说的
And as I told you before,

248
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,180
我很清楚李氏兄弟的勾当
I know the Lee brothers.

249
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,500
我还知道他们也要去切尔滕纳姆赛马会
And I know they're going to be at the Cheltenham races as well.

250
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,820
他们会把钱输在妓女和劣等赛马上
They're going to lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.

251
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,400
不  他们打算
No. They're planning on

252
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,930
仗着人多势众  敲诈勒索你的赌注登记人
showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies.

253
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,610
强收粉笔费  欺凌赌注负责人
Running chalk and rafflers.

254
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,060
你觉得我搞不定李氏家族吗
You think I can't handle the Lees?

255
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,860
只是一句朋友的忠告  仅此而已
Just a word of warning from a friend. That's all.

256
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,340
我们切尔滕纳姆见
I'll see you at Cheltenham.

257
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,100
我会从包厢里对你挥手致意的
I'll wave at you from my box.

258
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,200
你要是去赛马会的话
If you're coming to the races,

259
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,490
带上你那位漂亮的酒吧女招待
bring that pretty barmaid of yours.

260
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,270
已经叫了
Already invited.

261
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
同志们
Comrades -

262
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,910
大家都知道  像今天这样聚在一起是违法的
as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,720
总督察坎贝尔先生有令
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered

264
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,800
群体集会人数
that we are not allowed to assemble in groups

265
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,690
不得超过三人
of more than three people.

266
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,400
所以  为了遵守法律
So, to comply with the law,

267
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,110
请大家三人一组站成一堆
please now clump together in groups of three.

268
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,680
你们听到了吗  兄弟们
You hear that, boys?

269
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,290
他们曾吹响同样的哨声让我们超额完成任务
The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top,

270
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,040
现在他们想驱散我们
they now blow to try and break us up.

271
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,110
所以在特派员到来之前
So before the Specials get here,

272
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,170
所有想罢工的人们  举起手来
raise a hand, all those who want to strike...

273
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,540
现在解散吧  解散然后带着口信回家
Now disperse! Disperse and take the message home!

274
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,750
只要我们团结一致  就永不会被打败
United, we will never be defeated!

275
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,660
汤米  汤米
Tommy! Oi, Tommy.

276
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,700
到底发生了什么事
What the hell's been happening?

277
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,130
警察刚才突袭了一个工厂非法集会
The police had just raided a rally at the factory.

278
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,950
你说是不是弗莱迪·索恩回来了
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?

279
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,880
他是回来了  和艾达一起
I know he is. And he's with Ada.

280
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,460
要想找到伯明翰唯一的
How hard can it be to find

281
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,350
一位穿着4英寸高跟鞋的姑娘能有多难呢
the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?

282
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,720
她和共产主义分子在一起
She's with the commies.

283
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,490
城里到处都有他们的窝点
They have little rat holes all over the city.

284
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,010
我只想知道她在哪儿
I just want to know where she is.

285
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,920
汤米  你最好和亚瑟谈谈
Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well.

286
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,690
亚瑟又怎么了
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?

287
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
他又抑郁了
He's got the Flanders blues again.

288
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,350
人们一直问东问西的  我根本不知道答案
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.

289
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,240
你们家艾达结婚了  是真的吗
"Is it true your Ada got married?"

290
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,730
我说  我不知道
I say, "I don't know."

291
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,530
她现在住在哪里
"Where is she living now?"

292
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,300
我不知道
"I don't know."

293
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,660
亚瑟
"Arthur...

294
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,200
黑天鹅酒吧的爱尔兰人是谁杀的
"Who killed the Paddy from The Black Swan?"

295
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,560
我说  什么爱尔兰人
I go, "What Paddy?"

296
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,690
他们说
They say...

297
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,640
是你们剃刀党
"Is it you, Peaky Blinders,

298
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,420
把枪从伯明翰轻武器工厂偷走的吗
who stole the guns from the BSA?"

299
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,520
什么枪  汤米
What guns, Tommy?

300
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,560
亚瑟  你被毒打之后  我觉得你需要休息
Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break...

301
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,170
他妈的枪是怎么回事  汤米
What bloody guns, Tommy?!

302
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,840
亚瑟  我本来打算告诉你的
Arthur, I was going to tell you.

303
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,100
你本来打算告诉我的
You were going to tell me.

304
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,260
亚瑟  听我说
Arthur, listen to me.

305
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,380
你过去几年一直过得很艰难
You've had a hard time these past few years.

306
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,660
上帝知道
God knows you have.

307
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,400
你需要好好休息
You deserve some rest.

308
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,540
我们运气不错  交好运了
We had some luck. Some bloody luck.

309
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,030
上天把大批武器交到我们手上
It fell off a wagon into our laps.

310
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,270
你只需要知道
And all you need to know is,

311
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,650
现在手握机枪的是我们
it's us that has the machine guns now.

312
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,800
焦头烂额的是他们
And it's them that's in the mud.

313
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,690
明白吗
All right?

314
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,700
来吧  我有个惊喜给你
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

315
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,320
来吧
Come on.

316
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,690
惊喜  在哪儿呢
A surprise? Where is she?

317
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,210
你一直想要什么来着  亚瑟
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur? Eh?

318
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,220
我们在法国时  你经常说
When we were in France, you used to say,

319
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,590
等我回到英国  我要自己开一家酒吧
"When I get back to England, I want to own my own pub."

320
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,220
你变了  你现在通人情了  汤米
You've gone soft. You've gone soft, Tommy.

321
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,830
我们怎么知道这里是否出售
How do we know it's for sale?

322
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,480
对我们来说  任何东西都是待售的  亚瑟
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.

323
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,210
我们现在赚了很多钱
We're making a lot of money these days.

324
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,470
我们需要一个合法生意来洗钱
We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.

325
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
我不知道该怎么开酒吧
I wouldn't know what to do.

326
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,580
你三分之二的人生都泡在酒吧里
You've spent two-thirds of your life in pubs.

327
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,720
以前是喝酒  现在是倒酒
Just pour it instead of drinking it.

328
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,130
可我还是能喝酒的  对吧
But I can still drink it, right?

329
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,380
你的酒吧  你说了算
Your pub - you do what you want.

330
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,800
抱歉先生们  我不知道你们来了
Ah - sorry, gentlemen, I didn't hear you come in.

331
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,780
要点什么
What can I get you?

332
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,680
该死的熊孩子
Bloody kids.

333
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,380
另一个车轮也被扎破了
The other one's punctured as well.

334
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,630
坎贝尔先生想要个解释
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.

335
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,880
今天  一些工会煽动分子
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man

336
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,690
在伯明翰轻兵器工发动了一场罢工
brought the BSA out on strike.

337
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,110
是弗莱迪·索恩干的
It was Freddie Thorne.

338
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,520
我以为你答应过他不会回来了
I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.

339
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,620
我知道他在城里  我正在处理此事
I know he's in town. I'm dealing with it.

340
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,490
坎贝尔督察以为你能管好自己的地盘
Inspector Campbell thought you controlled your territories.

341
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,420
没错
Yeah.

342
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,660
我说了  我正在处理
I said I'm dealing with it.

343
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,080
我听说
I heard that, er...

344
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,560
弗莱迪和你妹妹结婚了
Freddie married your sister.

345
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,990
你的家庭成员可真牛啊
Some family you've got, eh?

346
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,240
我猜你等不及过圣诞节了
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.

347
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,110
把弗莱迪·索恩交给我们
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us

348
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,920
否则我们就把你妹妹算作共犯
or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.

349
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,270
她将因煽动骚乱去蹲个4年
She'll get four years for sedition.

350
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,280
或者你把他交出来  你妹妹就没事了
Or you can turn him in and your sister goes free.

351
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,070
我先告辞了  汤姆
I'll say good night then, Tom.

352
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,630
你看到弗莱迪·索恩了吗
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?

353
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,290
-没有  -那汤米呢
- No. - Or Tommy?

354
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,920
-我得找到弗莱迪  -先把这杯喝了吧
- I have to find Freddie. - Drink this first.

355
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,780
不  我必须找到他们
No, I have to find them,

356
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,050
我觉得他们要互相残杀了
I think they are going to kill each other.

357
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,900
等等
Wait.

358
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,090
谁要杀谁
Who is going to kill who?

359
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,400
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

360
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,360
你到底想怎么样  弗莱迪
What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?

361
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,400
我是来告诉你
I came to tell you...

362
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,970
你这样做是没用的  汤米
That's not going to work, Tommy.

363
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,840
波莉来过了  她给了我这些
Polly came round. She gave me that.

364
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,600
波莉一定是脑充血了
Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood.

365
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,600
也可能是酒喝多了
Or port wine.

366
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,160
我很欣赏你的坦诚
Your honesty is appreciated.

367
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,590
如果你不想利用这些
Now, if you're not going to use that thing...

368
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,750
我还没说完  坐下
I'm not finished. Sit down.

369
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,490
坐下  快坐
Sit down. Sit.

370
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,760
跟我说说枪的事
Talk to me about the guns.

371
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,810
你还记得我们以前常常跳进去
Do you remember we used to jump in here,

372
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,960
比赛谁游得最快吗
see who could swim the fastest...?

373
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,670
我是来谈正事的  汤米
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.

374
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,950
你觉得我们还能那样吗
Do you reckon we could still do it?

375
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,960
你害艾达怀上了你的孽种  
You loaded Ada with your bastard

376
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,990
就因为她是谢尔比家族的人
because she's a Shelby.

377
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,550
你以为这意味着你也能成个人物
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.

378
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,910
我不会让你为了革命事业毁了我妹妹的一生
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.

379
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,460
天呐
My God.

380
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,390
你居然这么认为
You actually believe that.

381
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,790
我爱她  汤米
I love her, Tommy.

382
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,060
我爱上她的时候  她才9岁  我也只有12岁
I've loved her since she was nine and I was 12.

383
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,810
她也一样爱我
And she loves me the same.

384
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,410
你知道连什么是爱都不知道吧
You even know the word?

385
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,720
你们的婚姻不会持久的
This marriage will not stand.

386
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,720
弗莱迪不要你的钱
Freddie didn't want your money.

387
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,490
现在警察说  如果我们不交出弗莱迪
And now the coppers are saying if we don't turn Freddie in,

388
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:30,270
他们会把艾达的名字也印在逮捕令上
they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well.

389
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,110
你的同情心就是这样的结果  波莉
That's where your compassion gets you, Poll.

390
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,910
从现在起  我们得按我的方法行事
From now on, we do it my way.

391
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,440
否则呢
Or what?

392
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,530
准备好了吗
Ready?

393
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,620
他们靠近过来了
They're getting closer.

394
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,400
我来领头  
I'll lead.

395
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,550
-小心点  丹尼  -汤米
- Watch yourself, Danny. - Tommy.

396
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,710
小心点  丹尼
Be careful, Danny.

397
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,890
汤米
Tommy!

398
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,780
汤米
Tommy!

399
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,060
汤米
Tommy!

400
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,590
汤米
Tommy?

401
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,600
汤米
Tommy!

402
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,010
汤米
Tommy?

403
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,500
门是开着的
It's open.

404
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,590
二等兵向您报告  长官
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.

405
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,650
稍息
At ease.

406
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,320
伦敦方面有什么消息
So, what news from London?

407
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,840
我去了一家酒吧  名叫红帽妈妈
I was in a pub - it was called Mother Redcap.

408
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,350
一家爱尔兰酒吧
An Irish pub.

409
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,190
我跟一些老家伙聊起了伯明翰的事
I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.

410
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,580
他说现在出麻烦了  一个爱尔兰共和军成员被枪杀
He said there's been trouble. An IRA man shot.

411
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,270
他说了很多  但我只听到一点
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard...

412
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,040
就是他们的最高指挥部认为
was that their high command

413
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,550
是剃刀党开枪杀的人
think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.

414
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,180
我立马登上最近的一班船来提醒你
Came up on the next boat to warn you.

415
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,110
是真的吗
Is it true?

416
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,380
不是
No.

417
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,250
但流言比真相传得快
But lies travel faster than the truth.

418
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,560
给他们传个口信
Get a message to them.

419
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,470
让他们派个人来谈判
Tell them to send someone to parley.

420
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,530
告诉他们这其中有误会
Tell them there's been a misunderstanding

421
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,370
我们不想惹麻烦
and we don't want any trouble.

422
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,090
你的麻烦已经够多了  对吧  汤米
You've got enough trouble - right, Tommy?

423
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,860
又是威士忌又是大麻
A whisky and a smoke.

424
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,870
我闻得出那种味道
I can smell it in the air.

425
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,880
我自己有时也会抽点
I use it sometimes myself.

426
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,640
我称之为"私人甜心"
I call it "My sweetheart".

427
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,940
他们派给我们最糟糕的任务  汤米
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.

428
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,050
是啊
Yeah...

429
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,640
而且我们他妈还是自愿的
..And we fucking volunteered.

430
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,130
有时  梦境会持续一整晚
Sometimes, it lasts all night.

431
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,350
我躺在这里
I lie here

432
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,260
听着他们用铲子和镐
and I listen to the shovels and the picks

433
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,210
挖那面墙的声音
against that wall there.

434
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,350
我祈祷着他们挖进来之前
And I pray the sun will come up at the curtains

435
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,470
太阳已经升起来了
before they break through.

436
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,150
不  我从不祈祷  而是希望
'No, I don't pray - I hope.

437
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,090
有时候能实现
'And sometimes, it happens.

438
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,360
太阳先升起来了
'The sun beats them.

439
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,330
但是大多时候
'But mostly...

440
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,320
是铲子挖通了墙
'The shovels beat the sun.'

441
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,880
我会尽我的职责  长官

442
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,930
你妹妹之前来过这里
Your sister was here.

443
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,440
她非常担心你和弗莱迪
She was worried. You and Freddie.

444
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,260
害她吐了
It had made her sick...

445
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,500
她现在没事了  但她现在这种情况
She's all right, but in her condition,

446
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,170
非常需要安宁
she needs peace.

447
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,890
女人间的谈话
Women talk.

448
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,830
女人就那样
That is something they do.

449
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,440
她说了一些关于你的事
She talked about you.

450
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,940
她说你有什么事都紧锁在心里
She said you keep everything locked up.

451
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,000
男人就这样
Well, that's what men do.

452
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,450
你妹妹人很好  我喜欢她
Your sister's nice. I like her.

453
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,630
她也挺不容易的
It can't be easy for her.

454
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,830
她的哥哥和丈夫  为同样一件事争斗
Her brother and her husband, fighting over the same thing.

455
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,680
男人有话也该说出来
Men should talk, too.

456
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,430
对你说吗
To you?

457
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,870
有何不可  
Why not?

458
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,680
我是酒吧女招待  这是我的工作
I'm a barmaid. It's my job.

459
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
男人总喜欢把烦恼告诉酒吧女招待
Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.

460
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,950
你和弗莱迪到底在为什么争斗
What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?

461
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,900
我明早9点来这里接你
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

462
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,760
你买礼服了吗
Did you buy a dress?

463
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,420
是的  我买了礼服
Yes. I bought a dress.

464
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,070
是什么样的
How does it look?

465
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,070
他加满了油  也增加了润滑
He's changed the oil and greased her up.

466
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,260
可以一直开到切尔滕纳姆  是吗科利
So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?

467
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,050
他很擅长修汽车  但那让他觉得难受
He's good with motors, but it pains him.

468
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,540
汽车没有感情  我没办法跟它沟通
No heart in motorcars. I can't talk with them.

469
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,910
是啊  汤米或许会需要快速大逃亡呢
Yeah - Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.

470
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,110
李氏家族的人会挤满赛马场的
The Lees will be all over the track.

471
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,840
以及肯波的手下  以及那些警察
And Kimber's men. And his coppers.

472
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,820
他们是那里的掌权者  汤米
They control the law down there, Tommy.

473
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,450
摇启发动机试试  查理
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.

474
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,620
这辆车只能坐4个人
This car only seats four.

475
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,450
你要想活着回来  可不能只带4个人去
You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.

476
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,270
只有我和一个女孩单独去
It'll be just me and a girl.

477
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,860
就我们两个去参加赛马会吗
Is it just the two of us going to the races?

478
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,440
差不多吧
Something like that.

479
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,110
立正
Attention!

480
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,260
好了
Right.

481
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,110
这是在大行动之前做最后的简报
This is what was known as the final briefing before going over the top.

482
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,520
沿着那条路走60英里就是切尔滕纳姆的赛马场
60 miles down that road is Cheltenham racetrack.

483
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,010
约翰尼  我们的任务是什么
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?

484
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,140
干倒李氏家族  亚瑟
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur.

485
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,450
说的好  
That's right.

486
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,440
李氏家族的人想从合法赛马业中骗钱
The Lees are skimming money off legal bookies.

487
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,650
强收粉笔费  盗卖博彩  毒打那些不肯买的人
Running chalk, selling rafflers, beating up them as won't buy.

488
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,890
但今天  我们要阻止他们
But today, we're going to stop them.

489
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,190
肯波的手下怎么了 
What about Kimber's men?

490
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,110
我觉得他好像有安保团队
I thought he had his own protection.

491
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,410
肯波的手下都堕落腐败了
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.

492
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,550
他们收受李氏家族的贿赂  睁只眼闭只眼
They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.

493
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,110
我们要向肯波展示该怎么对付那些人
We are going to show Kimber how it should be done.

494
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,060
现在拿上你们擅长的武器
Now take what you're good at.

495
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,830
你们当中带枪的  最好不要用
Those of you with guns, keep them out of it,

496
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,090
除非有人拿枪指着你
unless a gun is pulled on you.

497
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,060
我们要安静地完成这事
We want this done quietly.

498
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,010
我们什么时候分钱
So when do we share out the cash?

499
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,110
我们不分  不能拿那些钱
We don't. We're not keeping the cash.

500
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,650
你们现在加入汤米的队伍了  伙计们
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.

501
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,250
只能相信家族内部成员
Trust only kin.

502
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,870
出发吧
Let's go.

503
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,940
你确定我们可以进来吗
Are you sure we're allowed in here?

504
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,990
我更喜欢走后门进入赛马场
Well, I prefer to come to the races the back way.

505
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,420
那可以免去不少麻烦  
It keeps me out of trouble.

506
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,050
赛马场是个无法无天的地方
Tracks are lawless places.

507
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,290
我受不了小打小闹的犯罪分子  这边走
I can't stand petty criminals. This way.

508
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,500
我们可以押注吗  
Will we get to lay a bet?

509
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,680
不能  赌博是流氓恶棍才玩的
No - gambling is for mugs.

510
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,970
这边走
This way...

511
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,870
你该庆幸是跟我在一起
You're lucky you're with me

512
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,290
否则你把钱押在被操纵的比赛上就浪费了
or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.

513
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,810
我一直很好奇  你会如何操纵比赛
I always wondered, how do you fix a race?

514
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,180
我怎么知道
How should I know?

515
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,890
-好了  你来说  -什么
- OK, you do the talking. - What?

516
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,470
告诉安保人员  你是莎拉·杜根小姐
Tell security you are Lady Sarah Duggan...

517
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
借过  借过
Excuse us, excuse us...

518
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,840
康尼马拉的莎拉·杜根小姐
Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.

519
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,950
你跑出来找你那匹马的骑手  结果迷路了
You got lost when you went to look for the boy

520
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,400
你的马叫做  娇花
riding your horse - Dandy Flower.

521
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,200
如果他们问起我  就说我是个普鲁士人
If they ask about me, say I'm Prussian

522
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,050
并且不会说英语
and don't speak a word of English.

523
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,090
快点  美丽的小姐  让我的三英镑花的值一点
Come on, posh girl. Earn your three quid.

524
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,560
我还是更喜欢加里森酒吧一点
I still prefer the Garrison.

525
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,320
你会跳舞吗
Do you dance?

526
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
除非有人正式邀请我
If I'm asked properly.

527
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,690
康尼马拉的莎拉·杜根小姐  你愿意和我跳支舞吗
Lady Sarah of Connemara, will you dance with me?

528
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,760
罗伯茨  剃刀党的人混进来了
Roberts. The Peaky Blinders are here.

529
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,850
我告诉过你  肯波先生  他很有种  就是他
I told you, Mr Kimber. He's got some balls, that one.

530
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,310
那个女人的身材可真好啊
And she's got some body, that one.

531
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,310
交点粉笔钱吧
Chalk for your blackboards.

532
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,060
五美元一支
Five pounds a stick.

533
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,270
很高兴跟你做生意
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

534
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,190
你好啊  雷兹  生意怎么样啊
Hello, Raz. How's business?

535
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,370
他妈的  给我起来
Fucking...get up!

536
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,810
狗日的
Fucking...

537
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,650
别动  雷兹  否则我把你另一个耳朵也割掉
Stay still, Raz, or I'll take the whole ear off.

538
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,910
你可需要耳朵才能听见声音呢
And you're going to need your ears to listen.

539
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,710
不准再敲诈勒索比利·肯波的手下了
No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.

540
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,260
明白吗
Right?

541
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,420
我们现在是他们的保护伞
We're the protection now.

542
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,130
我把你这盗取的钱征收了
I commandeer this stolen money

543
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,300
记住这是剃刀党的命令
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

544
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,870
要么是你的左腿比你的右腿强健
Either your left leg is stronger than your right

545
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,360
要么就是我们在偷偷逃跑
or we're making a getaway.

546
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,370
-都不是  -我希望这跟刀片什么的无关
- Neither. - I hope this doesn't involve razor blades.

547
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,400
我只是想上升一个等级
I've decided to move up in the world.

548
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,440
成为一个合法的商人
Become a legitimate businessman.

549
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,190
-天啊  你是认真的  -我一直都是认真的
- My gosh. You're serious. - I'm always serious.

550
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,350
我们一路追着李氏家族的人
We chased the Lees across the track,

551
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,090
就沿着德文路往下跑
right the way down the Devon road.

552
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,970
我们把钱都拿回来了
We got every penny back.

553
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,140
礼服真漂亮  你可以穿去我的酒吧
Nice dress. You can wear that to my pub.

554
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,350
请兄弟们喝杯酒  有人受伤吗
Buy the boys a drink. Anybody hurt?

555
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,280
就割伤和淤青而已
A few cuts and bruises.

556
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,530
我们快走吧  莎拉小姐
Off we go, Lady Sarah.

557
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,420
-走路注意点  -借过
- Steady on... - Excuse me.

558
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,500
你的钱  肯波先生
Your money, Mr. Kimber.

559
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,140
从李氏兄弟手里抢回来的
Rescued from the Lee brothers

560
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,720
现在钱归原主
and returned to you

561
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,230
请求你认真听我说一次
with a request for a fair hearing.

562
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,180
你自己的安保队伍并不奏效  肯波先生
Your own protection is failing, Mr. Kimber.

563
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,910
你的手下被人敲诈欺凌
Your boys are taking cuts.

564
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,510
我建议从今往后
I want to suggest that from now on,

565
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,180
你把赛马场的安保工作都承包给剃刀党
you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders.

566
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,250
我们能让你少花不少冤枉钱  肯波先生
We would be saving you a lot of money, Mr. Kimber.

567
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,240
一大笔钱
A lot of money.

568
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,620
作为回报  你给我们
In return, you give us...

569
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,940
获利的5%
..5% of the take

570
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,450
及塞文河北岸每次比赛当中
and three legal betting pitches

571
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,940
三场合法赌马的操控权
at every race meeting north of the River Severn,

572
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,310
一年后提高到获利的6%
rising to six after one year

573
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,630
前提是我们双方都对此工作满意的话
if we are all satisfied with the service.

574
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,460
你怎么想  肯波先生
What do you say, Mr. Kimber?

575
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,640
我看  你还是去和我的会计谈生意吧
I say you talk business to my accountant.

576
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,560
我要跳舞
I want to dance.

577
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,040
你的同伴说我可以跟你跳这支舞
Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.

578
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,100
你一次能派出多少人同时执勤
How many men can you put in the field at one time?

579
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,860
现在失业的人可不少
There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.

580
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,910
每位赌注登记人配两名保镖
Two guards for every bookie.

581
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,480
每次赛马都如此吗
At every meeting?

582
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,430
我们跟一些吉普赛人中的好人有联系
We have contacts with good people among the gypsies.

583
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,460
我们总能提前知道李氏家族准备袭击哪里
We'll always know where the Lees plan to attack.

584
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,840
现在到处在罢工  世道又乱
With all the strikes and troubles,

585
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,060
警察根本靠不住
you can't depend on the police.

586
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,130
不管怎样  我们更坦诚
Anyway...we're more honest.

587
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,160
看来你们两个要成交了
Looks like you two are making a deal.

588
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,520
我们有进展
We are making progress.

589
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,640
那让我再加上一个小附加条件
Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.

590
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,010
听着  我们要去肯波家吃饭
So, listen...we're going to go for dinner at Kimber's house.

591
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,690
他在几英里远的地方有一栋别墅
He has a place a couple of miles away.

592
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,760
我得先去跟他的会计谈点生意  所以
I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...

593
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,240
你先去  跟肯波一起
You go on ahead, with Kimber.

594
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,620
只有我跟他吗
Just me and him?

595
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:20,140
对  我这里完事了就去  没问题吧
Yeah...until I'm done here. Is that all right?

596
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,080
我会多付你三英镑  算是补贴这多余的活儿
I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.

597
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,930
你认为我是个出来卖的妓女
You think I'm a whore?

598
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,490
每个人都是出来卖的  格蕾丝
Everybody's a whore, Grace.

599
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,180
只不过出卖的东西不尽相同罢了
We just sell different parts of ourselves.

600
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,110
你说过想要为我工作
You said you wanted to work for me.

601
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,770
想为我工作  你得机灵点
To do that, you have to sharpen up.

602
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,920
我们说好让他跟你独处两个小时
The deal is I give him two hours with you.

603
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,500
他觉得自己是大众情人
He thinks he's a ladies' man.

604
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,300
他认为自己能勾引你
He thinks he can seduce you.

605
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,980
如果你不愿意  可以攻击他的下体
Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.

606
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,710
我是合同条款中的一项
I'm a clause in a contract.

607
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,730
如果你想要加入我的组织
If you want to be part of my organisation,

608
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,820
你就得做点牺牲
you have to make sacrifices.

609
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,630
说好了吗
Do we have a deal?

610
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,940
给你点甜头  你可以去勾搭一下我那位
As a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.

611
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,680
是的  说好了
Yes, we have a deal.

612
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,030
-两个小时吗  -对
- Two hours? - Yeah.

613
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,750
赌个大的  赌十镑我一小时内就能上了她
Side bet. Ten pounds says I'll have her fucked in one.

614
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,540
小姐请吧
Mademoiselle.

615
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,990
我猜他说你可以上我  对不对
I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?

616
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,620
而他能去享用她
While he has her.

617
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,930
就是这么安排的  对吗
That's the arrangement, isn't it?

618
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,560
你那位可能是个妓女
Yours might be a prostitute,

619
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,970
但我不是
but I'm not.

620
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,190
我初遇他时  是个女帽制作师
I was a milliner when I met him.

621
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,800
我是个独立的女人
I was independent.

622
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,230
这顶帽子是我做的
I made this hat.

623
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,280
我做帽子的手艺很不错
I was a good milliner.

624
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,050
你的帽子很漂亮
It's a very pretty hat.

625
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,630
真的很漂亮
It really is.

626
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,190
那她是个妓女吗
So is she a prostitute?

627
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,880
说真话吗
God's honest truth?

628
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,300
我不知道她是什么人
I don't know what she is.

629
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,350
你之前在赛马场让我颜面尽失啊
You showed me up back there at the races.

630
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,670
不过你来教教我该如何跳舞吧
Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?

631
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,800
音乐太慢了  放查尔斯顿舞曲吧
The music is too slow. Put on a Charleston.

632
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,780
那我们就离得太远了  我想跟你这样跳舞
Then we'd be far away. I want to dance like this.

633
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,340
拜托  你之前身体可没这么僵硬  不是吗
Come on. You weren't so stiff back there, were you?

634
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,330
你来过这么大的别墅吗
You ever been in a house this big?

635
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,490
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

636
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,820
你简直像一位电影明星
You look like a bloody film star.

637
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,640
我想抽烟
I want a cigarette.

638
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,680
快看  我东西掉了  把它捡起来
Oh, look, I dropped something. Pick it up.

639
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:20,960
你自己捡
Pick it up yourself.

640
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,190
你他妈就是个酒吧女招待
You're a fucking barmaid.

641
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,440
如果我的杯子掉了  你得捡起来
If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.

642
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,510
我想看你把它捡起来
I want to watch you pick it up.

643
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,340
好了  你个小骚货  我本来不想动粗的
Right, you little slag. I have tried to be nice.

644
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,490
如果我的杯子掉到地上了
If I drop a glass on the floor,

645
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,450
你弯下腰
you bend over

646
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:44,520
然后捡起那该死的杯子  明白吗
and fucking pick up the fucking glass, OK?

647
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,800
-怎么回事  -不行  先生  不
- What?! - No, sir...no.

648
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,690
你跑来干什么  我还有一个小时呢
What are you doing here? I've got another hour.

649
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,650
稍等一下  听我说  好好听我说
Just wait - listen to me. Just listen to me.

650
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,430
我本打算就让你这么做了  但最后
I was going to let you go through with it, but in the end,

651
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,780
我的良知唤醒了我
my conscience got the better of me.

652
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,770
她外表看起来不错
She looks good on the outside...

653
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,690
但她得了性病
but she has the clap.

654
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,280
没错  是梅毒
Yeah. Syphilis.

655
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,300
当你对她很中意时  我想我可以利用她
When you took a shine to her, I thought I'd use her.

656
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,720
有人告诉我她得了梅毒
Somebody told me she had syph

657
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,010
我心想"有什么关系"
and I thought, "What the hell?"

658
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,340
你就当我这是良心发现吧
Call it my better nature.

659
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,700
她  她是个妓女
She's...she's a whore.

660
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,960
-出去到车里等我  -我自己能走
- Just go and wait in the car. - I can walk on my own!

661
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,050
我们能握下手  然后忘掉这一切吗
Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?

662
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,890
今天开始时  我是康尼马拉的莎拉·杜根小姐
Start of the day, I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

663
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,160
最后  我是个得了性病的妓女
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.

664
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,760
你他妈是个混蛋  那样把我卖了
You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.

665
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,590
但之后你改了主意
But then you changed your mind.

666
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,140
你为什么改变主意了  汤玛斯
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?
