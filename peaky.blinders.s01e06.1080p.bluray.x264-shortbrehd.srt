13
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,050
如果能跟你合作真的很荣幸  肯波先生
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,970
没人可以跟我合作  都只能在我手下工作
Nobody works with me. People work for me.

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,600

格蕾丝  你愿意嫁给我吗
Grace...will you marry me?

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,160
你可以找到比我更好的
You deserve better.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,790
是因为他吗
Is it him?!

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,620

上帝啊  一定要让今天顺利度过

我在战时每天早晨都祈祷

66
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,080
我曾希望我可以最后一次祈祷就完事了
I hoped I'd done it for the last time.

67
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,500
今天就是你最后一次祈祷了  波莉

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,060
我怀着沉重的心情给你写这封信

我在报告中一字都不会提的

但是  你必须明白

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,180
我知道你已献身于我们不共戴天的仇敌
that I know you gave yourself to the man who is our sworn enemy.

101
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,400
那不仅是通敌行为
'That is not only treason,

102
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,800
更是恶心至极的行为
'it is disgusting beyond all measure.

103
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,530
你父亲一定会以你为耻的

你已经背叛了你生来就享有的

一切荣耀和遵从的原则

我没带武器
I am unarmed.

117
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,760
真奇怪啊  督察
It's curious, Inspector.

118
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,510
我以为你是来清理这座城市的
I thought you came here to clean up the city.

119
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,010
而不是来跟妓女上床的
Not to sleep with its whores.

120
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,690
你跟之前来的警察没两样
You're no different from any other copper that came before you.

121
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,840
我和那些在我走后来接替我的人也没两样
I'm no different from those who would follow should I choose to leave.

122
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,890
你没理由留下
You've no reason to stay.

123
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,860
你的目的已经达到了
You have what you came for.

124
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,970
是的  我的目的达到了
Yes. I have what I came for.

125
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,790
我中午要和温斯顿·丘吉尔先生开会
I have a meeting with Mr Winston Churchill at midday.

126
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
无疑他会恭喜我
And no doubt he intends to congratulate me

127
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,170
寻回了那些被盗的枪支
on finding those stolen guns.

128
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,860
你还是不知道我们是怎么找到的  对吧
And you still don't know how we found them, do you?

129
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,770
很好
Good.

130
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,680
你走狗屎运罢了
Oh, you got lucky.

131
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,080
是吗
Did I?

132
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,280
是的
Yeah.

133
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,590
我学到的一件事
One thing I have learned...

134
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,080
就是你我既对立  又统一
is that you and I are opposites, but also just the same.

135
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
就好像镜中像
Like an image in a mirror.

136
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,270
我们讨厌别人
We hate people.

137
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,340
别人也讨厌我们
And they in turn hate us.

138
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,770
惧怕我们
And fear us.

139
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,850
今天  你会心碎
Before the day is over, your heart will be broken...

140
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,350
正如我一样
just the same as mine.

141
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,190
像我们这样的人  谢尔比先生
Men like us, Mr Shelby...

142
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,160
注定永远孤独
will always be alone.

143
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,620
我们得到的爱
And what love we get...

144
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,970
都必须付出代价
we will have to pay for.

145
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,980
你忘了  督察
You forget, Inspector.

146
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,130
我有家人
I have my family.

147
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,820
祝你今天过得愉快
Enjoy your day.

148
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,500
小家伙
Oh, little one...

149
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,660
你比我更会跟他相处
You're much better with him than I am.

150
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,860
他这么快就安静下来是因为我身上没有奶味
He settles quicker with me cos he can't smell the milk.

151
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,830
你累了  把他放回摇篮里吧
You're tired. Let's put him down.

152
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,400
我家孩子特爱咬乳头
Mine were terrors for the tit.

153
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,420
两个都是
Both of them.

154
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,610
你不认识我的孩子们吧
Well, you never knew my children, did you?

155
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,980
不  我自己当时都还是个孩子
No, I was a child myself, then.

156
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,110
你从没提起过
You never talk about them.

157
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,640
没理由说
Never had reason to.

158
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,690
一想到他们我就心疼
My heart breaks even when I think about them.

159
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,920
但今天
But today...

160
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,700
有理由了
I do have reason to.

161
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,830
坐下  艾达
Sit down, Ada.

162
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,790
他们一个三岁  一个五岁
They were three and five years old.

163
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,030
萨莉三岁  迈克尔五岁
Sally was three, Michael was five.

164
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,860
再过两周就六岁了
Two weeks away from being six.

165
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,870
那是周日早晨  我去教堂了
It was Sunday morning. I was at church.

166
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,910
"上帝不会原谅你"
"You're not forgiven."

167
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,600
一个苦瓜脸贱人跟我说  "上帝不会原谅你"
This... pinch-faced bitch said to me, "You're not forgiven."

168
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,970
我洗完晾在外面的床单上
You see, some sheets I washed and hung on the line

169
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,000
印着一家酒店的名字
had the name of a hotel on them.

170
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,630
那些床单在一件劫案中被偷
They'd been stolen in a robbery,

171
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,140
警方说酒店的服务员被人用短棍袭击了
and they said some porter at the hotel had been coshed.

172
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,880
附近有个女人把床单的事告诉了警方
And a woman from round here told the police about the sheets -

173
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,480
就是因为嫉妒我有新床单
jealous, you see, of the new sheets.

174
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,220
警察到来的时候
And when the police came,

175
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,080
发现一个用来制作杜松子酒的酒馏器
they found a spirit still for making a few drops of gin.

176
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,120
为此
And for that...

177
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,270
他们夺走了我的孩子们
They took my children from me.

178
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,120
也不告诉我将他们送去了哪
And they never told me where they took them.

179
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,550
他们这么做是因为他们有这个能力
And they did it cos they could.

180
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,230
因为我很软弱
And cos I was weak.

181
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,660
但他们绝不会夺走你的孩子
But they will never take your baby away from you.

182
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,560
知道为什么吗
Do you know why?

183
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,090
因为汤米不会让他们这么做
Cos Tommy wouldn't let them.

184
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,220
因为汤米不会让他们欺负我们
Cos Tommy won't let them walk all over us.

185
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,360
是汤米给了这个家族力量和权力
Now it is Tommy who has given strength and power to this family.

186
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,150
因为他知道
Cos he knows...

187
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,280
要生存就得比他们都凶狠
you have to be as bad as them above in order to survive.

188
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,550
我告诉你是因为我希望你能原谅他
I'm telling you this cos I want you to forgive him.

189
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,110
我怎么原谅他
How can I?

190
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,220
他害我的弗莱迪锒铛入狱
When my Freddie's rotting in jail because of him.

191
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,280
今天有些事你得知道
There's something about today you need to know.

192
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,730
好了  弗莱迪  该走了
All right, Freddie, time to go.

193
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,420
给坎贝尔传个信
I want to get a message to Campbell.

194
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,840
我绝不能被转去布里克斯顿
I can't let them move me to Brixton.

195
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,120
要是我去了那里  他们就会杀了我
If I go to Brixton, they'll kill me.

196
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,410
弗莱迪
Freddie.

197
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,460
你到不了布里克斯顿监狱的
You're not going to get as far as Brixton prison.

198
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,830
站起来
On your feet.

199
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,610
我亲自告诉首相
I told the Prime Minister personally

200
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,400
枪支已经寻回
that the guns had been retrieved

201
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,310
他真的认真听了
and he actually heard me and listened,

202
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,720
我很肯定他还微微一笑
and I'm pretty sure he gave me a half smile.

203
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,490
只有政敌死了他才会笑
He never usually smiles unless a political opponent dies.

204
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,780
我准备在新年授勋嘉奖名单中将你提前
I plan to put your name forward in the New Year's Honours list...

205
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,240
我受不起  长官
That would be too much, sir.

206
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,630
胡说  你应得的
Nonsense. You deserve it.

207
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,800
我记得你给我写过几封信
As I recall, you wrote to me several times

208
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,570
信中提到了一位女卧底
about an undercover operative. A woman.

209
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,400
寻回枪支一事  她出力了吗
Was she involved in the discovery?

210
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,440
值得我嘉奖她吗
Does she deserve some kind of commendation?

211
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,380
是的
Yes.

212
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,320
她帮了大忙
She was instrumental.

213
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,530
是王室忠诚的仆人
A truly loyal servant of the crown.

214
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,800
她的档案中必须记下这些杰出的表现
And that is what the record should state.

215
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,120
那些偷枪的人呢
And what of the men who actually stole the guns?

216
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,060
剃刀...
The Peaky...

217
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,210
党  长官
Blinders, sir.

218
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,300
如果去抓人
If we were to make arrests,

219
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,310
整件事就会曝光
the whole thing would end up in open court,

220
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,860
我深知您希望这件事能保密
and I know we wish to keep this matter confidential.

221
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,680
就这么放过他们吗
So they'll go free?

222
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,220
也不尽然  长官
Not quite, sir.

223
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,660
其实  我有针对剃刀党的计划
You see, I have plans for the Peaky Blinders.

224
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,350
你好啊
All right.

225
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,960
-你好  -你好啊  伙计
- All right. - All right, mate?

226
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,640
别弄了  晚点再来
Leave that, boys, come back to it later.

227
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,970
好了
Right.

228
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,530
今天我把大家召集在一起
I've brought you all here today

229
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,610
是因为今天我们将要取代比利·肯波
because this is the day we replace Billy Kimber.

230
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,440
从今天起我们将迈入上流社会
This is the day we become respectable.

231
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
今天我们将加入
The day we join

232
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,860
官方的全国赌马经营者协会
the official National Association of Race Course Bookmakers.

233
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,500
但首先
But first...

234
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,700
我们要干些不光彩的事
we do the dirty work.

235
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,880
我们都知道这一天迟早要来
We've all known it's been coming.

236
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,060
只是我从未说过具体是哪天
I just haven't told anyone the date.

237
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,560
我们出发去乌斯特赛马场
We're going to the Worcester races.

238
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,100
赛马场一点开门  我们两点到那
The track opens at one, we get there at two.

239
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,550
肯波以为我们去那
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there

240
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,530
是为了帮他对付李氏兄弟
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

241
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,190
但多亏了我们的约翰
But thanks to the efforts of our John,

242
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,410
以及他可爱的新婚妻子伊丝米
and his lovely new wife Esme,

243
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,080
现在李氏和我们是一家人了
the Lees are now our kin.

244
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,200
我今早打断了他们的好事
I interrupted those efforts this morning, and, er...

245
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,230
我向大家保证
I can assure you all,

246
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,150
约翰为和平大业做出了巨大的牺牲
John is making great sacrifices in the cause of peace.

247
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,710
好吧  行啦
Yeah, all right.

248
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,370
我们将和李氏家族一起对抗肯波的手下
So, it'll be us and the Lees against Kimber's boys.

249
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
我们干掉他们  把赌注经纪人留下
We take them out, then leave the bookies.

250
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,410
我希望能速战速决
I expect a swift victory

251
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,420
然后消息会传遍整个伦敦
which will send a signal all the way to London,

252
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,130
那就是我们相信
that we believe

253
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,830
可以和平地经营合法业务
in letting legitimate businesses run peacefully.

254
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,880
还有  肯波要怎么处理
And, er... what about Kimber himself?

255
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,240
我来处理肯波
I'll deal with Kimber.

256
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,460
还有别的问题吗
Any other questions?

257
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,220
有
Yes.

258
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,090
如果我带一个新人参加会议  有人反对吗
Oh, does anyone object if I bring a newcomer to the meeting?

259
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,620
进来吧
Come on.

260
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,960
容我向大家介绍谢尔比家族的新成员
I'd like to introduce the newest member of the Shelby clan.

261
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,560
欢迎回家  艾达
Welcome home, Ada.

262
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,870
我们给他起名叫卡尔
We named him Karl.

263
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,920
为纪念卡尔·马克思
After Karl Marx.

264
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,360
狗日的卡尔·马克思吗
Karl bloody Marx?

265
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,780
让我看看他
Let me get a look at him.

266
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,240
他又来了
Oh, here we go.

267
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,320
快看  他长得跟我简直一模一样
Eh, look. He looks just like me, look.

268
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,350
他的屁股长得像你吧  亚瑟
That's his arse looks like you, Arthur.

269
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,710
他帅着呢
He's all right.

270
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,740
他是谢尔比的一员
He's a Shelby.

271
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,150
艾达
Well, Ada?

272
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,600
你原谅我了吗
Am I forgiven?

273
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,210
如果波莉阿姨说的是真的  那我原谅你
If what Aunt Polly says is true, you are.

274
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,360
是真的
It's true.

275
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,540
谢谢你  汤米
Thank you, Tommy.

276
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,090
你到底是什么人
So, who the hell are you?

277
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,330
一个想保住自己眼睛的人
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

278
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,440
他们跑到我家
They came to my house.

279
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,680
让我主动要求负责此事
Told me to volunteer for this.

280
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,180
他们是什么人
Who did?

281
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,870
是剃刀党
Peaky Blinders.

282
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,940
汤米啊汤米
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy...

283
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,420
别挡路
Get out of the way!

284
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,940
那他妈是怎么回事
What the bloody hell is that?

285
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,650
看来你的朋友到了
Looks like your friends are here.

286
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,160
趴在地上
Stay down on the ground.

287
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,840
否则一枪毙了你
Or the next one's for you.

288
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,220
下手狠一点
Make it look good.

289
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,730
我很抱歉  同志
I am sorry about this, comrade.

290
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,650
我的天啊
Holy shit.

291
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,710
丹尼  你不是死了吗
Danny, you're dead.

292
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,820
没  我一直住在伦敦  都是一码事
Nah. I've been living in London. Same thing.

293
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,880
你给我进去
In you get.

294
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,280
好了  伙计们  听我说
All right, lads, listen up.

295
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,790
你们只能喝一杯啤酒和姜汁酒  不要贪杯
You have a pint and a chaser, no more.

296
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,920
我请客
On the house.

297
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,430
很好  开始倒酒吧
Right. Let's get pouring.

298
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,790
你有观众席的票吗
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

299
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,980
以及赛马场所有簿记员的花名册
And the register of book-keepers on the track?

300
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,400
在我的大衣口袋里
In me coat.

301
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,950
你干的不错  格蕾丝
You did a good job, Grace.

302
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,510
就是那么回事  对吧
That's what it is, isn't it?

303
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,900
下次家族会议时  我会带你参加的
The next family meeting, I'll make sure you're there.

304
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,750
我要是你的家人才能去  但我不是
If I were family. But I'm not.

305
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
那是可以改变的
That could change.

306
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,540
汤米
Tommy...

307
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,810
等我回来我们再详谈  好吗
We'll talk about it more when I get back. All right?

308
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,120
你什么时候回来
When will you be back?

309
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,370
以后你都要这么问东问西了  对吗
Oh, is this how it's going to be, eh?

310
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,970
你在家里等我
You waiting at home for me,

311
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,080
问"你知道现在几点了吗"
saying, "What time do you call this?"

312
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,060
得换酒桶了
The barrel needs changing.

313
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,040
去吧  汤米  到后面去
Go on, Tommy, go out the back,

314
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,670
在我们走之前好好和她干一炮
give her a good seeing to before we go.

315
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,930
格蕾丝
Grace.

316
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,900
格蕾丝  我只是开玩笑
Hey, Grace, I was joking.

317
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,310
汤米  我们需要更多的淡啤
Tommy, we need more mild!

318
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,510
你们自己倒吧
Just help yourselves.

319
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,480
汤米  事实是
Tommy, the truth is

320
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,190
当你从赛场回来时  我已经离开了
when you come back from the races, I won't be here.

321
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,670
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

322
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,900
好了
All right, look.

323
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,980
格蕾丝  我知道现在的自己配不上你
Grace, I know you weren't born to be with a man like me...

324
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,170
但我正在扭转这一局面
but I'm turning things around.

325
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,200
当我今晚回到这里时
And when I get back here tonight...

326
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,380
我将拥有全国数一数二的
I will have one of the biggest

327
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,130
合法赌马财团
legal racetrack syndicates in the country.

328
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,740
我也会了结其他一些事
And I'm going to close down some of that other stuff.

329
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,540
也许可以开个俱乐部
Maybe open a club, hey?

330
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,270
就像伦敦那样
Like in London.

331
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,010
另外就是
And another thing.

332
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,780
你有一份雇佣合同
You have a contract of employment.

333
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,970
跟一家真正的有限公司签的  还记得吗
with a real limited company. You remember?

334
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,510
我什么都记得  汤米
I remember everything, Tommy.

335
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,850
我会取得成功的
I am going to make a success of this.

336
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,460
我一定会成功的
I am going to make a success of it.

337
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,390
-我一定会  -我知道  知道
- I am. - I know. I know.

338
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,180
我现在不是在谈结婚的事
And I'm not talking about marriage.

339
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,210
我是
I'm...

340
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,940
我们彼此了解  真心交流
We know each other. We can talk.

341
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,850
我们是一样的人
We're the same...

342
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,580
汤米  我对你做了些可怕的事
Tommy, I have done something terrible to you.

343
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,180
把你刚告诉我的话转述给他
Right, tell him what you just told me.

344
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,610
我听说有两辆大蓬货车开到斯特拉福德路了
Just heard there's two vans driving up the Stratford Road.

345
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,890
我的一个旧下士认出了其中几个人
An old corporal of mine said he recognised some of the men.

346
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,010
他说是肯波的手下  他们正往这边来呢
He said it's Kimber boys, and they're heading this way.

347
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,200
艾达  快醒醒
Ada, wake up.

348
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,090
你带着孩子去斗牛场商业中心那边
You and the baby get into the Bull Ring,

349
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,040
那里人多
where there's lots of people.

350
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,410
-怎么回事  -我们他妈的被卖了
- What's going on? - We've been fucking betrayed.

351
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,210
有人走漏了风声  肯波的人正赶过来
Someone let slip. Kimber's men are on their way here.

352
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,780
即便如此  但你能对付他们的吧  汤米
Yeah, but you can handle them, Tommy?

353
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,810
只有我们在
It's just us.

354
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,660
李氏家族的人都在去乌斯特的路上  我们寡不敌众
All the Lees are on their way to Worcester. We're outnumbered.

355
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,780
操
Fuck!

356
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,610
还有谁知道你们今天要去对付肯波的事
Who else knew today was the day you were moving on Kimber?

357
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,770
你说过你守口如瓶了  你还告诉谁了
You said you kept it a secret. Who else did you tell?

358
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,070
只有一件事能蒙蔽像你这么聪明的人  汤米
There's only one thing can blind a man as smart as you, Tommy.

359
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,460
爱
Love.

360
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,200
是那个酒吧女招待干的
It was that barmaid.

361
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,540
格蕾丝的事我来处理
I'll deal with Grace.

362
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,620
如果你再看见她  可能会杀了她的
If you set eyes on her again, you might kill her.

363
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,490
想一走了之吗
Going for good?

364
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,180
我听说有麻烦了
I heard there was trouble.

365
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,390
人的本能是件很有意思的事
Instinct's a funny thing.

366
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,270
通常我可以看出一个人的品性  但对于你
See, normally I can tell about a person. But with you...

367
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,430
战斗即将开始  我们该离开这儿
Look, the fighting's about to begin. We should get out of here.

368
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,380
我们知道你是谁
We know who you are.

369
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,350
汤米也知道
Tommy knows as well.

370
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,740
实际上今早那个警察已经告诉他了
Turned out that copper as good as told him this morning.

371
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,240
不过我想听你亲口说
But I wanted to hear it from your own lips.

372
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,730
我是国王麾下的一个密探
I am an agent of the crown.

373
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,150
我有权使用武力逮捕你
I have the power to arrest and the right to use force.

374
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,250
所以  请你别挡道
So, please, step out of my way.

375
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,190
正如我所说  人的本能很有意思
Like I say, instinct's a funny thing.

376
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,230
你真的爱上汤米了  不是吗
You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?

377
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,250
我的枪可是上了膛的
This gun is loaded.

378
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,020
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

379
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,160
我为你感到遗憾
I feel sorry for you.

380
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,670
真是个了不起的小丫头
Slip of a thing.

381
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,450
你竟以为可以深入这里  把我们一网打尽
Thought you'd come in here and stitch us all up.

382
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,060
没错  我们这儿是有几个警察的眼线  但你
I mean, we've had some copper's narks in here, but you?

383
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,390
你简直是其中的女王
You're the queen of them all.

384
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,330
你到底是谁
So, who are you?

385
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,060
我猜你是富家小姐  工会主义分子
Rich girl, I'd guess. Unionist.

386
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,180
阿尔斯特志愿军
Ulster Volunteer.

387
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,880
你觉得芬尼亚运动成员
You thought Fenians,

388
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,110
共产主义分子  低等人
Communists, low people...

389
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,920
他们都一个样  都是渣滓
they're all the same. Scum.

390
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,440
然后你遇到了汤米
Then you met Tommy.

391
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,690
我要用拳头跟你打一架
I'll fight you with my fists

392
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,970
让你看看富家小姐是怎么打架的
and show you how a rich girl fights.

393
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,090
我也来自一个艰苦的家庭
I'm from a tough family, too.

394
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,660
不了
Nah.

395
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,740
我们女人要理智一些
We women have more sense.

396
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,190
为什么不倒上两杯酒呢
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

397
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,170
我说对了吗
So, am I right?

398
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,810
你爱上了汤米吗
Did you fall for Tommy?

399
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,370
-是的  -那我为你感到惋惜
- Yes. - Then I pity you.

400
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,310
我觉得他会杀了我
I think he'll try to kill me.

401
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
-他太软弱了  -软弱
- He's too soft. - Soft?

402
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,090
和你一样  软弱
Soft. Like you.

403
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,220
警察来的那个晚上  你救了他的命
You saved his life the night the coppers came.

404
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,400
所以我们才能坐在这儿喝酒  而不是打架
That's why we're drinking, not fighting.

405
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,840
我们欠你的
We owe you.

406
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,000
他去法国前  是什么样子的
What was he like...before France?

407
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,320
他经常笑
He laughed, a lot.

408
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,900
他喜欢和马一起相处
He wanted to work with horses.

409
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,630
他赢了不少奖章
He won medals.

410
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,920
都扔进切割机里去了
Threw them in the cut.

411
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,720
没有一个人从战场回来后还和从前一样
Ah, not a single man came back the same.

412
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,040
在这一切结束后
You know, after all this is over...

413
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,030
他也许会原谅你
He might forgive you.

414
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,030
他也许会接受你
He might take you in.

415
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,450
你永远无法知道男人会做出什么事
You can never tell with men.

416
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,800
他们的喜好全凭肉欲
They go for whoever their dicks point at,

417
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,610
他们的想法永不会变
and there's no changing their minds.

418
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,350
但我告诉你
But I should tell you something.

419
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,680
我永远不会原谅你
I will never forgive you.

420
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,450
不会接受你
or accept you.

421
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,800
也不会接纳你
or take you in.

422
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,400
在这个家里  我掌控着大家的心理
And it's me who runs the business of the heart in this family.

423
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,500
而对我来说  你是来自警方的探子
And as far as I'm concerned, you're a snitch from the Parish.

424
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,270
在明天之前如果你不从这个城市消失
And if you're not gone from this city by tomorrow...

425
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,140
我会亲自杀了你
I'll kill you myself.

426
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,040
现在  你走吧
Now, go.

427
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,530
也许真正使你心烦的是
Maybe what really upsets you

428
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,290
你觉得总有一天你可能会失去他
is the thought that one day you might lose him.

429
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,490
汤米
Tommy.

430
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,530
我们听海米尔斯那边的伙计说
We've had word from Nipper at Hay Mills,

431
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,160
是警察放他们通行的
and he says the police are letting them through.

432
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,830
警察怎么都消失了
And how come all our police have disappeared?

433
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,570
因为把我们的计划告诉肯波的正是警察
Because it was the police who told Kimber about our plan.

434
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,850
是谁告诉警察的
And who told the police?

435
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,960
你知道吗  约翰
You know what, John?

436
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,920
虽然我觉得自己挺聪明
For all I think I'm the smart one...

437
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,850
但我猜  是我走漏了风声
I'm guessing it was me.

438
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,480
好了  兄弟们
All right, men...

439
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,680
你们大多经历过战争
You were mostly in the war,

440
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,860
所以你们知道作战方案经常变动
so you know that battle plans always change

441
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,800
经常被搞砸
and get fucked up.

442
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,950
现在情况正是如此  计划有变
Well, here it is. Things have changed.

443
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,150
我们要在这里和他们战斗
We fight them here.

444
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,960
今天  孤军奋战
Today. Alone.

445
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,970
挺好  他们会向酒吧发动进攻
Now, they're going to come for the pub.

446
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,220
他们想让我们永世不得翻身
They're going to try to break us up for good.

447
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,820
今天  警察也对我们弃之不顾
And we'll have no help from the law today.

448
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,480
那家酒吧叫做加里森[堡垒]
That pub there is called the Garrison.

449
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,330
现在它是名副其实的堡垒了
Well, now it really is one.

450
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,980
它是属于我们的  对吗
And it belongs to us, right?

451
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,220
对
Right!

452
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,370
他们有多少人
How many are there?

453
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,850
贾玛尔说有两辆莱利大蓬货车
Jeremiah says two Riley vans.

454
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,600
估计我们要一对三
So I reckon we're outnumbered three to one.

455
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,530
操他娘的
Ah... Fuck.

456
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,300
但兄弟们  我们可是小希斯步枪
But it's us, boys. It's us. The Small Heath Rifles.

457
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,230
-我们战无不胜  是不是  -是
- Never lost a fight yet, did we? - No!

458
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,780
好  贾玛尔
All right. Jeremiah.

459
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,200
我知道你向上帝发誓绝不再动武
I know you vowed to God to never pick up a weapon again.

460
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,100
但你能代我问问他  你今天会帮助我们吗
But can you ask him from me if you can help us today?

461
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,210
上帝说  他不管小希斯  先生
God says he don't deal with Small Heath, sir.

462
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,100
好样的
Good man.

463
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,430
亚瑟  斯卡德伯特  你们负责侧翼
Arthur, Scudboat. You take the flanks.

464
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,910
-跟在圣玛丽时一样  -是
- Just like at St Marie. - Sir.

465
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,030
科利  任何一个谢尔比家的人今天死在这里
Curly, if any Shelby man dies here today,

466
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,480
你都要把我们埋在一起
you bury us side by side.

467
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,710
好吧  我们大概还有10分钟  
All right. We've about ten minutes.

468
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,780
找个人做临终忏悔去吧
Make your peace with whoever.

469
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,300
我们收到线报称有一大群人坐车
We've had a report of a large group of men in vehicles

470
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,790
往城里来了
heading towards the city.

471
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,830
他们中的大多数都是警察熟悉的惯犯  长官
Most of them are known to the police, sir.

472
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,570
我们认为即将爆发一场黑帮火拼
We think a gang fight's about to break out.

473
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,520
我要以下地点的
I want all officers and

474
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,880
所有官员和巡警全部撤退
constables stood down in the following areas.

475
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,450
博德斯黎  小希斯  夏德坊  格雷特
Bordesley, Small Heath, Shard End, Greet...

476
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,380
和海米尔斯
and Hay Mills.

477
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,240
-撤退吗  先生  -立刻
- Stood down, sir? - Immediately.

478
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,030
不要阻止这些车进城
And the vehicles approaching the city should not be impeded.

479
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,590
到底是什么情况
What the hell is going on?

480
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,770
狗咬狗去吧
Let dog eat dog.

481
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,270
让他们斗个两败俱伤
Let the beasts devour each other.

482
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,330
我们再渔翁得利吧
And then we shall pick the bones.

483
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,660
她走了吗
She's gone, then?

484
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,000
你不习惯
You're not accustomed to

485
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,960
得不到你想要的东西  对吧  汤米
not getting what you want, are you, Tommy?

486
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,500
你想得到我的酒吧  你就拿去了
You wanted my pub and you took it.

487
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,320
你卖了个好价钱
You got a fair price.

488
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,230
我只得到一纸最后通牒
What I got was an ultimatum.

489
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,610
你给别人下的全是最后通牒
Like you give to everybody.

490
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,470
别敬酒不吃吃罚酒
Do it, or else.

491
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,640
但有意思的是
And yet, it's funny.

492
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,330
这里的每个人  都希望你赢得这场战斗
Everybody round here, they want you to win this battle.

493
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,310
我想是因为
I think, what it is...

494
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,230
你是个坏人  但你是我们的坏人
you're bad men, but you're our bad men.

495
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,740
你会去找她吗
Will you go looking for her?

496
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,720
她已经成为过去了
She's in the past.

497
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,310
我不关心过去
The past is not my concern.

498
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,620
也不再关心未来
The future is no longer my concern, either.

499
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,420
那你关心什么  汤米
What is your concern, Tommy?

500
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,200
一分钟
The one minute.

501
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,240
士兵的一分钟
The soldier's minute.

502
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,200
在战斗中  你只有这一分钟时间
In a battle, that's all you get.

503
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,450
一切都在这一分钟内爆发
One minute of everything at once.

504
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,730
此前的一切都成虚无
And anything before is nothing.

505
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,730
此后的一切
Everything after...

506
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,660
也都是虚无
nothing.

507
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,850
什么都比不上
Nothing in comparison...

508
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,370
那一分钟
to that one minute.

509
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,540
你在那里经历的次数还不够多吗
Didn't you get enough minutes over there?

510
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,710
好像是不够  不是吗
Seems not, doesn't it?

511
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,690
汤米  他们来了
Tommy, they're here.

512
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,830
掏出家伙  兄弟们  装上子弹
Get your weapons out, boys, and load 'em up.

513
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,620
慢慢来
Take your time.

514
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,800
都给我举着  让那些人瞧瞧我们的武器装备
Hold 'em up in the air so as they can see what we've got.

515
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,410
有枪没种是吧  比利小子们
All guns and no balls, right, Billy boy?

516
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,840
那我们现在要怎么做
So, what do we do now?

517
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,690
下命令吧
Just give the order.

518
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,410
到达加里森街的那些人都配有步枪
The men that have arrived in Garrison Lane are armed with rifles.

519
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,460
你听到我说的话了吗
Did you hear me?

520
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,480
我不关心他们如何自我毁灭
Their methods of self-destruction are not my concern.

521
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,970
我们还收到线报说萨尔特利有人使出机关枪了
Well, we've also had report of machine gun fire in Saltleigh.

522
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,050
不过是患有弹震症的老兵在胡说八道
The ravings of an old soldier with shell shock.

523
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,370
25挺刘易斯机关枪我们只找到了24挺
We only found 24 of those 25 Lewis guns.

524
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,050
如果他们要是用了这一挺
If they were to get to use the one...

525
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,470
当时...
You know, when, er...

526
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,490
你从贝尔法斯特来这里的时候  我欣喜若狂
when you came here from Belfast I was overjoyed.

527
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,730
我受够了这里的警界  受够了这里的腐败堕落
I was sick of this force, and I was sick of all the corruption.

528
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,130
你演讲声称要肃清这里的时候
When you made that speech about cleaning this place up,

529
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,690
我心里一阵欢呼
I gave a little cheer inside.

530
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,310
你说只有恶魔才会睁一只眼闭一只眼
You said it was the devil's work to look the other way.

531
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,680
我没有睁一只眼闭一只眼  莫斯警官
I am not looking the other way, Sergeant Moss.

532
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,760
我一直在盯着今天要发生的事情
I am looking directly at the events of the day.

533
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,080
那正是我喜闻乐见的
And I like what I see.

534
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,730
没必要闹到这步田地  肯波
It doesn't have to be like this, Kimber.

535
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,050
一切都太迟了
Too late for all that.

536
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,300
你贪心不足导致大祸临头  小杂种
You've bit off more than you can chew, you little toerag.

537
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,870
所以我要来接管这个鬼地方了
And now I'm going to take over this shithole.

538
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,150
如果非得用枪
We have to use guns...

539
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,650
那就得用好枪
let's use proper guns.

540
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,310
索恩军士前来报道  长官
Sergeant Thorne reporting for duty, sir.

541
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,340
你刚刚不是说枪比我们多吗
You were saying something about being out-gunned.

542
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,580
让开
Move!

543
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,350
你在干什么
What are you doing?

544
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,970
我想你们管这里叫无人地带没错吧
I believe you boys call this "No-man's land."

545
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,640
-艾达  -闭嘴听我说
- Ada... - Shut up and listen.

546
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,950
-你疯了吗  -我说了闭嘴
- Have you lost your mind? - I said shut up!

547
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,350
你们中大多数人都去过法国参战
Now, most of you were in France.

548
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,220
所以你们一定知道接下来会怎么样
So you all know what happens next.

549
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,070
我的兄弟和丈夫此刻都站在这里
I've got brothers and a husband here

550
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,310
也一定有人在等着你们
but you've all got somebody waiting for you.

551
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,180
我提前穿上丧服做准备
Now, I'm wearing black in preparation.

552
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,620
我要你看着我
I want you to look at me.

553
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,950
我要你们都看着我
I want you all to look at me.

554
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,420
谁会为你们穿丧服
Who'll be wearing black for you?

555
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,460
想想他们
Think about them.

556
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,160
现在就想想他们
Think about them right now.

557
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,760
还想斗就斗吧  但我不会移走这孩子的
And fight if you want to, but that baby ain't moving anywhere.

558
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,940
我也不走
And neither am I.

559
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,490
她说得对
She's right, you know.

560
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,890
你们凭什么要死
Why should all you men die?

561
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,700
只有导致这一切的那个人该死
It should just be them who's caused it.

562
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,450
别开枪
Don't shoot!

563
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,760
你没事的  孩子  你没事的
You're all right, son. You're all right.

564
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,990
艾达  快走开
Ada, move away.

565
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,650
别开枪
Don't shoot!

566
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,420
把枪举起来
Hold your guns up!

567
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,520
够了
Enough.

568
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,120
这场战斗由肯波和我单挑
Kimber and me fought this battle one on one.

569
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,860
现在一切结束了
It's over.

570
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,570
回去找你们的家人吧
Go home to your families.

571
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,750
斯卡德伯特  科利  把他抬起来
Scudboat, Curly...pick him up.

572
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,000
我想问你一个问题  之后我就会离开
I want to ask you one question. Then I'll leave.

573
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,480
汤米知道我是谁  你跟他说什么了
Tommy knows who I am. What did you say to him?

574
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,830
你跟他说什么了
What did you say to him?

575
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,090
我告诉他
I told him...

576
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,820
他会在明天之前心碎
..that his heart would be broken before the day was over.

577
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,010
所以看来
So, it seems...

578
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,860
你弄碎了两个人的心  格蕾丝
You've broken two hearts, Grace.

579
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,850
我自己的心也碎了
As well as my own.

580
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,900
坚持  汤米  坚持
That's it, Tommy, that's it.

581
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,390
坚持住  汤米
Bite it, Tommy.

582
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,470
拿出来  快拿出来
Take it. Take it!

583
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,470
-按住他  -坚持    
- Hold him still. - That's it, lad.

584
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,790
加油  加油
Come on. Come on!

585
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,130
取出来了  我还是宝刀未老
There! I still have the knack.

586
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,190
喝一口
Have a drink.

587
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,200
好  深呼吸
Right, deep breath.

588
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,540
好了  结束了
That's it. It's done.

589
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,710
现在可以好好把他葬在
Now we can bury him properly

590
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,110
之前为他挖的坟墓里了
in the grave we dug for him.

591
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,910
在高高的山坡上  他会喜欢的
It's high on a hill. He'll like that.

592
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,750
-敬高速炮弹丹尼  -丹尼
- To Danny Whizz-Bang. - Danny.

593
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,730
愿所有人都可以死两次
May we all die twice.

594
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,610
敬高速炮弹丹尼
To Danny Whizz-Bang.

595
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,450
高速炮弹丹尼
Danny Whizz-Bang.

596
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,940
走吧
Come on.

597
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,530
今天是我们的大好日子  去庆祝吧
The day is ours, let's celebrate.

598
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,250
怎么样
Well?

599
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,650
谁赢了
Who won?

600
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,770
找到了威廉·肯波被人枪杀的尸体
A Mr William Kimber has been found dead with a gunshot wound.

601
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,960
所以我猜是剃刀党赢了
So, I'm guessing that means the Peaky Blinders won.

602
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,220
长官
Sir.

603
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,070
另外  那个共党分子  弗莱迪·索恩
Also, the communist agitator Freddie Thorne

604
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,510
在押运期间被人持枪劫走了
was taken from his transport by armed men.

605
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,650
由于当时街上没有警察
Since there were no police officers on the street at the time...

606
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,140
那完全是遵照您的命令
following your orders...

607
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:04,430
他轻松逃掉了  现在逍遥法外
he managed to escape easily and is now at large.

608
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,460
狱警说他认出了劫持他的人
The prison officers said they recognised the men.

609
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,210
也是剃刀党的人  长官
They were Peaky Blinders as well, sir.

610
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,330
我们可以去抓几个人来问问
I mean, we could go down there and make a few arrests

611
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,760
但肯定问不出什么
but, er, no-one will have seen anything.

612
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,370
而且因为没有其他警官做证人  所以
And there were no officers there to witness, so...

613
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,490
谢尔比家的人连谋杀罪都可以逃掉了
The Shelbys will get away with murder.

614
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,110
就像以前一样
Just like they always have.

615
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,440
有些事是不会变的
Some things never change.

616
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,470
对吗  长官
Eh, sir?

617
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,020
敬
A toast...

618
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,330
敬谢尔比有限公司
A toast, to Shelby Limited!

619
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,870
谢尔比
Shelby!

620
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,050
他有几个儿子  我们该帮他们找个工作吗
He's got sons. Should we find work for them?

621
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,740
不  让他们自由发展吧
No. Let them be.

622
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,580
让他们找个普通的工作  做个普通的人
Let them find ordinary work like ordinary men.

623
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,880
请帮我接丘吉尔先生
Could you put me through to Mr Churchill, please?

624
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,280
长官
Yes, sir.

625
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,370
长官
Sir...

626
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,560
我为我的仕途做了一个决定
I have made a decision about my future.

627
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,020
所有人都要走了
Everyone's leaving town.

628
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,390
-汤米你受伤了  -我没事
- Tommy, you're hurt. - I'm fine.

629
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,740
我该说什么
What exactly can I say?

630
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,090
我不知道  格蕾丝
I don't know, Grace.

631
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,610
我可以告诉你我的真实身份
I could tell you who I really am.

632
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,670
我觉得我已经知道了
I think I know who you are.

633
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,930
你也知道我
And you know who I am.

634
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,930
琐事细节并不重要
The circumstance is not important.

635
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,580
-琐事细节  -仅此而已
- Circumstance? - Is all it is.

636
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,840
那只是公事
Just uniform.

637
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,900
总有一天我会把枪扔进大运河
Someday I will throw this gun in the canal.

638
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,010
为什么现在不行
Why not now?

639
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,330
但爱就是这么来了  汤米
Here it comes, Tommy.

640
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,390
我爱你
I love you.

641
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,780
也就这么散去了  格蕾丝
And there it goes, Grace.

642
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,060
就这样散去
Away it goes.

643
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,710
我们不管再说多少次
We can say it as much as we like...

644
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,750
也是不可能的
But there's no chance.

645
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,900
我会在伦敦呆一周  地址在这里
I'll be in London one week. This address.

646
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,870
忙完这里的事然后来找我
Finish your business here and join me.

647
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,060
我有个主意
I have an idea.

648
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,010
-他来了  汤米  -要酒吗
- There he is... Tommy. - Drink?

649
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,710
不要威士忌
Not whisky.

650
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,620
你看吧台后面
If you check behind the bar...

651
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,230
有一瓶香槟
you will find a bottle of champagne.

652
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,850
是她买的
The one she bought.

653
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,430
今天是个好日子
Today was a good day.

654
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,060
当肯波的人都聚在这里的时候
All of Kimber's men were busy here,

655
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,000
李家的人抢到了所有乌斯特比赛的操控权
so the Lee boys took all the pitches at the Worcester races.

656
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,140
简直比事先安排的还好
It couldn't have gone better if we'd planned it.

657
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,540
谢尔比兄弟有限公司
Shelby Brothers Limited

658
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,150
现在是这个国家
are now the third largest

659
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,160
第三大的合法赌马公司
legal race track operation in the country.

660
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,870
干杯  只有萨比利公司
Cheers! Only the Sabinis

661
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,040
和所罗门公司在我们之上
and the Solomons are bigger than us, boys.

662
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,440
我所有家人都在此庆祝
And all my family is here to celebrate.

663
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,820
敬谢尔比兄弟有限公司
To Shelby Brothers Limited.

664
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,060
谢尔比  兄弟
Shelby! Brothers!

665
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,090
干杯
Cheers.

666
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,150
还有其它人
There'll be others.

667
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,000
敬其它人
To the others.

668
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,540
所有人
All of them.

669
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:49,850
谢尔比兄弟有限公司

670
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,070
亲爱的格蕾丝
Dear Grace...

671
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,510
没有了秘书  我只能亲手写这封信
Without a secretary, I write my own letters

672
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,530
我对你毫无恨意
and I write without malice.

673
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,230
我很久前就学会憎恨我的敌人
I learnt long ago to hate my enemies.

674
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,190
却从没爱过任何人
But I've never loved one before.

675
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,560
一起去纽约的主意很棒
The idea of New York is interesting

676
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,190
但我为了今天的胜利  努力了很久
but I have worked so hard for this day, for this victory.

677
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,700
我在这里肩负着重要责任
I have responsibilities here

678
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,620
要去保护那些需要保护的人  和我爱的人
for people I need to protect and people who I love.

679
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,900
战争之前  当我需要做重大决定的时候
Before the war, when I had an important decision to make,

680
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,430
我喜欢扔硬币
I used to flip a coin.

681
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,950
也许这次也要这样决定了
Perhaps that is what I will do again.

682
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,230
波莉告诉我  你是真的爱上我了
Polly tells me you fell in love for real

683
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,960
她对这种事的直觉向来都是准的
and Polly is never wrong about matters of the heart.

684
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,500
我会在三天内告诉你我的决定
I will give you my decision within three days.

685
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,440
爱你的  汤玛斯·谢尔比
All my love. Tommy Shelby.
