1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,730
前情提要

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,550
他是总督察
He's a Chief Inspector.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,700
我猜他是要对共产主义分子下手
I reckon it's Communists he's after.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,080
那个警察是不会来找我们麻烦的  对吧
So this copper's going to leave us alone, right?

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,310
什么情况
What the fuck?!

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,060
我希望你把这当做我对你的自我介绍
I want you to see this as me introducing myself to you.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,990
他说是丘吉尔阁下派他来伯明翰的
He said Mr. Churchill sent him to Birmingham.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,190
跟盗窃案有关
Something about a robbery.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,540
汤玛斯  你经营赌马公司  但你不傻
Thomas, you are a bookmaker, you're not a fool...

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,720
你敢把枪卖给任何一个能发挥其用武之地的人
You sell those guns to anyone who has use for them,

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,970
你就死定了
you will hang.

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,800
我只是个多嘴的共产主义穷小子
I am just a poor communist frog with a big mouth.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,530
我跟你在一起
I'm with you

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,230
因为你是这里唯一不怕他们的男人
cos you're the only man round here not scared of them.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,780
弗莱迪  你和我之间唯一的区别
The only difference between you and me, Freddie,

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,580
就是有时我的马还有可能赢
is that sometimes my horses stand a chance of winning.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,960
汤米
Tommy!

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,370
你现在还操纵比赛了吗
You fixing races now?

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,210
我是来应聘酒吧女侍的
I'm here about the job as barmaid.

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,910
你打入进去了吗
Are you in position?

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,350
是的  先生
I am, sir.

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:05,980
第一季   『人人影视英剧社倾情奉献』   第二集

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,660
我以为你是要带我们去集市呢
I thought you said we were going to the fair.

24
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,740
先谈生意要紧  下车吧
We have business first. Come on.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,800
放机灵点
Bring your wits.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,080
-谈什么生意  -那是李氏家族的人
- What business? - That's the Lee family.

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,010
汤米
Tommy!

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,460
约翰尼·道格斯
Johnny Dogs.

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,540
汤米  你最近怎么样
Tommy, how the hell are you?

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,060
出城呼吸下新鲜空气  人清爽多了
All the better for getting the city smoke out of me lungs.

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,320
我以为你现在已经看不上我们了
I thought you became a bit too grand for us.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,450
我最近太忙了
I've been busy.

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,850
我现在跟着李氏家族做事
I'm riding with the Lee family now.

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,230
我听说了
I heard.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,730
换做是我  我宁可跟猪住在一起
Myself, I'd rather live among pigs.

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,980
行了  汤米  别引发争端
Come on, Tommy. No disputing.

37
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,960
自你从法国回来后第一次来集市吗
So, your first fair since France...?

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,020
你知道法国什么事啊
What do you know about France,

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,390
你个怕打仗的吉普赛小杂种
you war-shy Gypsy bastard?

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,020
就是这匹马吧
So this is the horse.

41
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,770
就是那辆车吧
And that's the car.

42
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,640
等一下
Hang on a minute.

43
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,650
你不会想要拿家庭用车换那匹该死的马吧
You are not swapping the family car for a bloody horse.

44
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,540
当然不是交换
Of course we're not swapping it.

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,760
那简直是疯了
That would be mad.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,410
我们要用抛双币来决定
We're going to play two-up.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,220
浴   血

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,220
黑   帮

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,220
第一季   『人人影视英剧社倾情奉献』   第二集

50
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,460
给你
Here you are.

51
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,640
我就知道  就知道
I knew it. I knew it.

52
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,240
汤米  你个该死的白痴
Tommy, you bloody idiot.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,030
闭嘴  亚瑟  我赢了
Shut up, Arthur, I won.

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,940
我答应过约翰尼如果他输了
I promised Johnny I'd let him

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,860
就让他开车出去兜一圈
have a spin in the car if he lost.

56
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,860
那就好
All right.

57
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,170
你们这帮姓李的小子们是在笑话我大哥吗
Are you Lee boys laughing at my brother?

58
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,810
是吗
Are you?

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,250
汤米
Tommy...

60
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,130
-汤米  -我问你们话呢
- Tommy. - I asked you a question!

61
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,130
汤米  好了  他们就是图个乐而已
Tommy, come on, it's just the craic...

62
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,820
带你的家人离开这  好好逛集市去吧
Get your family out of here and go and enjoy yourselves at the fair

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,200
别让他们挑起争端
before they start a war.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,490
快点  走啊  他们出生于上流家庭
他们的祖父曾是称霸一方的王

65
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,300
他们的祖父曾是称霸一方的王

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,870
没错  但他妈妈就是个吉普赛婊子
Yeah, but his mother was a Didicoy whore.

67
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,770
我们要赶在他们昨晚喝的啤酒化成尿
We will take them before last night's beer

68
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,600
在他们心中的邪恶苏醒前  将他们一举抓获
turns to piss and wakes the devils up.

69
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,460
我们不要放过任何地方
We will leave no stone unturned.

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,410
每把枪  每颗子弹
Every gun, every bullet

71
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,780
都要带回来做进一步检查
will be brought to me for inspection.

72
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,930
现在
Now...

73
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,210
各就各位吧
take your positions.

74
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,730
不要打我  放开我
Don't hit me! Get off me!

75
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,210
弗莱迪
Freddie!

76
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,710
你确定你的兄弟们都去集市了吗
You're sure your brothers are at the fair?

77
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,580
他们才不会敲门呢
If it was them they wouldn't knock.

78
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,830
索恩先生
Mr. Thorne...

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,070
什么事
What is it?

80
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,330
警察正在围捕共产主义分子
The police are rounding up the communists.

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,170
快点  艾达
Come on, Ada,

82
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,130
如果警察找到我  我们就完蛋了
if the cops find me we are screwed.

83
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,250
妈的
Fuck...

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,090
-弗莱迪·索恩  快开门  -艾达
- Freddie Thorne, open up! - Ada...

85
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,220
你得跳下来  艾达  我会接住你
You have to jump, Ada. I'll catch you.

86
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,430
快跳
Come on.

87
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,800
看这个
Look at this.

88
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,600
一张铁元素补充剂的处方
A prescription for iron tablets...

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,030
患者是该死的艾达·谢尔比
for Ada fucking Shelby.

90
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,970
多诺万太太  我需要你帮忙
Mrs. Donovan, I need that favour.

91
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,210
-速度进屋  -不是我要进去  是她
- Come in and be quick. - I'm not coming in. She is.

92
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,990
我的老天  是谢尔比家的女孩
Holy Jesus, it's the Shelby girl.

93
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,720
别说你看到过她跟我在一起  多诺万太太
You have not seen her with me, Mrs. Donovan.

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
请她喝杯茶
Give her a cup of tea and

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,980
等警察走了再让她离开
let her stay until the police have gone.

96
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,670
她是那帮剃刀党恶魔的妹妹
She's the sister of those Peaky Blinder devils...

97
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,940
但她却是位天使
And yet she is an angel.

98
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,250
快点  艾达
Come on, Ada.

99
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,260
你要怎么办  弗莱迪
What are you going to do, Freddie?

100
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,550
我吗  我得出城避避风头
Me? I'm going to have to leave town for a bit.

101
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,310
真正的绅士会摘下他的帽子
A gentleman would take off his hat...

102
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,820
熄灭他的烟斗
and put out his pipe.

103
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,120
我发现你们这帮特派员只有在
I see you Specials only dare to come here

104
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,430
那帮小子们去集市时  才敢来这里
when you know the boys are away at the fair.

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,860
你是说你的外甥们吗
You mean your nephews...

106
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,310
天天挥舞着他们的枪跟剃刀
with their guns and their razors?

107
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,600
你是在为他们点蜡烛吗
Is it them you're lighting candles for?

108
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,920
不是
No.

109
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,980
我是为那些早逝的加里森青年们点的
I am lighting candles for the boys from the Garrison

110
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,130
他们牺牲在了法国
who lost their lives in France.

111
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,740
那里有份名单
There's a list there.

112
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,910
抬起头来看
Look...

113
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,390
我听说你没去过法国  坎贝尔总督察
I hear you didn't make it to France, Inspector Campbell.

114
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,820
你听说过我
You've heard of me.

115
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,290
我也听说过你
I've heard of you.

116
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,730
你是在找圣杯吗
Is it the Holy Grail you're looking for...?

117
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,440
事实上
As a matter of fact...

118
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,720
我就是在找圣杯呢
it is the Holy Grail I'm looking for.

119
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,970
那是些宝贝  但却被偷了
Something precious. Something stolen.

120
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,330
或许你明白我指的是什么
Perhaps you know what I'm talking about.

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,700
真抱歉  您这样把我抵在墙上
Sorry, I misunderstood your intention

122
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,510
我误会您的意思了
when you pushed me to the wall.

123
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,010
把这儿给我翻个底朝天
Turn the place upside down.

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,430
亚瑟·谢尔比说你们愿意帮忙
Arthur Shelby said you people would help us.

125
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,580
我们都不知道你丢了什么  要怎么帮忙找
If we don't know what you've lost, how can we help you find it?

126
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,660
但后来我意识到我是找错了人
But I've found out subsequently that I was speaking to the wrong man.

127
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,030
下次  我要找老大问话
Next time I want to talk to the boss.

128
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,680
利奇茶馆  周五十点
The Lickey Tea Rooms. Friday. Ten o'clock.

129
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,910
我说的老大  是指汤玛斯
And when I say the boss, I mean Thomas.

130
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,250
走吧
Come on.

131
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,320
真他妈的
The scum of the Earth...

132
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,980
这儿他妈是出了什么事了
Now what the bloody hell's been going on here?

133
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,760
天呐
Jesus Christ.

134
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,080
警察跟大家说这是亚瑟被捕时允许了的
The coppers told everyone Arthur had agreed to it when he was arrested.

135
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,500
他们说剃刀党
They said the Peaky Blinders

136
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,770
故意去集市躲避着  好让他们动手
had cleared out to the fair to let them do it.

137
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,340
我可没跟那警察说
I never said nothing to that copper

138
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,400
他们可以来砸人家的房子
about smashing up bloody houses...

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,780
行了  他们去搜查了哪些酒吧
All right... which pubs did they do?

140
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,030
火枪酒吧  铁链酒吧和侯爵酒吧
The Guns, the Chain, the Marquis.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,110
都是交了保护费的
All the ones that pay you to protect them.

142
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,310
就是没去加里森
The only one they didn't touch was the Garrison.

143
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,340
好让人们相信这事是我们主使的
Make sure people think we were in on it.

144
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
那个警察很精明
He's smart, this copper.

145
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,330
快点行动啊
So, go on.

146
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,160
把酒喝了  然后出去
Drink your beers, get out.

147
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,860
你们得让大家知道你们仍旧是这里管事的
You'd better show people you're still the cocks of the walk.

148
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,220
给酒吧的房东拿些钱
Hand out some cash to the landlords of the pubs.

149
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,420
雇几个老兵去把那儿修好
Pay some veterans to fix the places up.

150
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,320
伙计  把包给我
Oi, Nipper. Give us the bag.

151
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,190
你呢  汤米
So, what about you, Tommy?

152
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,150
我得把马牵去查理那儿
I have to go to Charlie's to stable the horse.

153
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,030
它似乎生了脚疮
She looked foot-sore in the box.

154
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,360
让他们看见你
Let them see your faces.

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,380
我们都知道他们到底在找什么
So we both know what they were looking for.

156
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,070
你不读报纸吗
You don't read the papers.

157
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,740
只读关于赌马的
Racing papers.

158
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,980
那我跟你说说情况吧
So let me tell you the odds.

159
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,180
我敢以三赔一的赔率打赌会发生革命
I reckon it's three to one there'll be a revolution.

160
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,040
我可不会拿这种事打赌
I wouldn't bet on that.

161
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,950
那个警察也赌会这样
That copper's betting on it.

162
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,310
他不找回那些枪是不会罢休的
He's not going to let it rest till he gets those guns back.

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,990
他找你谈过了吗  波莉
Did he talk to you, Pol?

164
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,070
在教堂里
In the church.

165
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,980
他还去找艾达了吗
Did he try to find our Ada?

166
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,580
她当时在睡觉
She was sleeping.

167
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,850
她在哪睡的  波莉
Where was she sleeping, Pol?

168
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,940
我以为你不在乎女人的事呢
I thought you didn't care for women's business.

169
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,540
他知道你才是老大
He knows you're the boss.

170
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,660
他要见你
He wants to meet you.

171
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,230
你会去跟他谈谈吗
Will you talk to him?

172
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,270
不
No...

173
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,370
处于守势的人不能谈判
you don't parley when you're on the back foot.

174
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,580
我们得先回击一拳
We'll strike a blow back first.

175
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,850
芬恩  你干什么呢
Finn, lad? What are you doing?

176
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,360
我们要点火了
We're having a fire.

177
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,200
两先令换国王的画像
Two bob for your picture of the King.

178
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,980
什么
What?

179
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,720
拿去清水巷
Bring it to Watery Lane.

180
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,160
-芬恩  好伙计  -斯卡德  你好啊
- All right, Finn, lad. - All right, Scud.

181
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,290
我们要把入口拦住
We are blocking the entrance, mate.

182
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,460
来  继续往前走  来吧
Come on, keep making your way through. Come on.

183
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,290
来吧  先生们
Come on, gentlemen.

184
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,180
快点
Now come on...

185
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,380
丢进去吧  伙计们
Chuck them on, boys.

186
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,110
我希望你明白自己在干什么
Well, I hope to God you know what you're doing.

187
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,900
我是《伯明翰晚报》的记者
I'm a reporter with the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

188
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,500
我接到电话赶来的
I had a phone call.

189
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,480
是个叫汤玛斯·谢尔比的人
Someone called Thomas Shelby.

190
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,970
跟我来
Come with me.

191
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,120
来  借过
Come on, folks, give us a bit of room.

192
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,750
汤米
Tommy.

193
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,110
-大家让一让  -您是谢尔比先生
- Move back for us, please, folks. - You're Mr Shelby?

194
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,960
-大家退后一点  -正是
- All the way back, please. - I am.

195
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
你说我不用担心安全
You said I would be protected.

196
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,590
你绝对安全
You're protected.

197
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,920
怎么回事
What's going on?

198
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,090
我要你写点东西
There are some things I want you to write down.

199
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,130
首先
Now, first of all...

200
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,370
并不是这里的人民不效忠国王
it's not that people round here are disloyal to the King.

201
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,020
恰恰相反
It's the opposite.

202
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,990
是这样  我们不想让敬爱的国王看到
You see, we don't want our beloved King looking down

203
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,470
我们遭受的不公待遇
and seeing the things that are being done to us.

204
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,570
所以我们摘下了他的画像
So we are taking down his pictures.

205
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,350
但你为什么要烧掉呢
But why are you burning them?

206
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,860
我们为国王九死一生
We went through hell for our King.

207
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,320
走过战火  把这都写下来
Walked through the flames of war. Write all this down...

208
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,150
如今却在自己家门口受到攻击
And now we're being attacked in our own homes.

209
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,280
那些从贝尔法斯特来的新警察
These new coppers over from Belfast,

210
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,340
他们闯进我们家
breaking into our homes

211
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,900
骚扰我们的女人
and interfering with our women.

212
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,610
我们认为国王肯定不忍看到这样的事情
We don't think our King would want to see that happening.

213
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,290
所以我们点火警示世人
So, we're lighting fires to raise the alarm.

214
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,190
我能问您  您是什么身份吗
May I ask you, in what capacity do you speak?

215
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,780
没什么身份
No capacity.

216
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,910
我只是一介草民
I am an ordinary man.

217
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,490
我在索姆河一役中赢得了英勇勋章
I won Gallantry Medal at the Somme.

218
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,200
我要你在你的报纸上刊登这里发生的事
I want you to write in your paper what's going on here.

219
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,280
走吧  去写
Go on, go.

220
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,070
请进
Come in.

221
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,550
那个
Here, eh...

222
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,870
有电话找您  长官  是伦敦打来的
there's a telephone call for you, sir, on the London line.

223
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,850
是吗  这都要午夜了
There is? It's almost midnight.

224
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,850
是温斯顿·丘吉尔先生  长官
It's Mr Winston Churchill, sir.

225
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,280
您好  阁下
Yes, sir?

226
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,920
坎贝尔督察
Inspector Campbell?

227
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,770
我听说你城里有人聚众焚烧
I hear there has been a bonfire in your city.

228
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,240
是有报告称9点左右清水巷有几人在烧东西
There was a small fire reported around nine o'clock on Watery Lane.

229
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,620
不过您完全无需为这种小事担心  阁下
But it was certainly nothing to trouble you about, sir.

230
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,570
但恐怕我已经在担心了
Ah, but I'm afraid it has troubled me.

231
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,120
半小时前  我收到一封
Half an hour ago I received a wire communication

232
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,790
来自《伯明翰晚报》的编辑的电报
from the editor of the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

233
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,800
他的一名记者受邀参加了焚烧聚会
It seems one of his reporters was invited to the fire

234
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,460
发现他们在焚烧国王的画像
and discovered that they were burning pictures of the King.

235
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,710
国王的吗
Of the King?

236
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,730
任何可能导致国王陛下难堪的报道
Any newspaper report which may cause embarrassment to His Majesty

237
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,310
都是首要大事
is always referred first

238
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,260
也是内政部的例行公事
and as a matter of routine to the Home Office.

239
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,530
我会立刻赶过去  逮捕涉案人员
I will go down there immediately and arrest those involved.

240
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,290
不  你绝对不能抓人
No, you most certainly will not make arrests.

241
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,440
你抓了人  就还得审讯
If there are arrests there will be trials,

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,270
一旦审讯  就会有更多报社报道
if there are trials there will be more newspaper reports,

243
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,030
而这必然会提到
which will necessarily mention

244
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,710
焚烧国王画像的事情
the burning of the King's likeness.

245
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,370
我把你派到伯明翰有一个特殊原因
I put you in Birmingham for one very specific reason.

246
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,580
让你寻找失窃枪支一事到底有没有进展
Are you any nearer to finding those stolen guns?

247
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,960
我们取得了一些进展
We are making steady progress...

248
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,090
我们要的是结果  
We need results.

249
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,600
-晚安  坎贝尔先生  -阁下
- Good night, Mr Campbell. - Sir...

250
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,800
我能问问  那篇报道
Could I at least ask, does this report

251
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,950
有提到某些参与者的名字吗
name any of those involved?

252
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,800
提到了一个叫汤玛斯·谢尔比的
It names a Mr Thomas Shelby.

253
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,510
报道提到他是一位战争英雄
The report mentions he is a war hero.

254
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,980
你终于出现了
Good of you to join us.

255
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,050
-你这一天都上哪儿去了  -躺床上啊
- Where have you been all day? - In bed.

256
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,200
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

257
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,570
然后又睡得醒不来
Then I couldn't wake up.

258
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,870
后来我很冷  后来我不得不起床撒尿
Then I was cold and then I had to go for a wee.

259
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,080
我和一头熊同坐一条船
Then I was with this bear on a boat,

260
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,870
但那只是个梦
but that was a dream.

261
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,340
再后来我就饿了
Then I was hungry.

262
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,100
你为什么要看报纸
Why are you reading the paper?

263
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,890
我为什么不能看
Why wouldn't I be?

264
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,390
我从没看你读过报纸
I've never seen you read the paper.

265
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,800
我只看过你拿来点火
I've only ever seen you light fires with them.

266
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
伯明翰轻武器公司罢工了
The BSA are on strike.

267
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,940
矿工罢工了
The miners are on strike.

268
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,380
爱尔兰共和军一天内杀了我们10个孩子
IRA are killing our boys ten a day.

269
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,510
怎么了
What?

270
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,500
站起来
Stand up.

271
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,720
为什么
Why?

272
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,440
站起来就是了
Just stand up.

273
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,830
侧过身去
Side on.

274
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,340
天啊  你在干什么
Hoi! What are you doing?

275
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,340
艾达
Ada...

276
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,720
月经比正常晚来多久了
how late are you?

277
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,670
一周
One week.

278
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,550
五周了
Five weeks.

279
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,770
算上周末就七周了  我以为是因为缺铁
Seven if you count weekends. I think it's a lack of iron.

280
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,580
我拿了点药片
I got some tablets.

281
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,710
但不管用吗
But they didn't work?

282
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,240
没用
No.

283
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,600
你可以穿上衣服了  亲爱的
You can get dressed now, love.

284
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,380
那我到底有没有怀孕
So, am I or not?

285
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,290
赶紧走  艾达 
Keep bloody walking, Ada.

286
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,830
被人看到我们在这儿  他们肯定会知道的
If anybody sees us here they'll know.

287
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,500
我不会打掉孩子的  波莉阿姨
I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol.

288
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,050
回家后我们再商量这事儿
Just come home and we'll talk about it.

289
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,530
你别抓着我  不然我就叫了  我发誓
You get off me or I'll scream out, I swear.

290
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,490
好  如果你想在大街上谈  那就开始吧
All right, if you want to do this on the street, let's do it.

291
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,860
谁的孩子
Whose is it?

292
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,320
如果我告诉你  你就会告诉他们  
If I tell you, you'll tell them

293
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,250
他们会把他碎尸万段的
and they'll cut him to pieces.

294
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,110
如果他娶了你  他们就不会那么做
Not if he marries you they won't.

295
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,110
他会娶你吗
Will he marry you?

296
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,160
我不知道  我不知道他上哪儿去了
I don't know. I don't know where he is.

297
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,870
-老天啊  艾达  -他跑了  但他说会回来的
- Jesus Christ, Ada. - He's gone away, but he said he'd come back.

298
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,410
是啊  男人都说自己会回来的
Yeah, but they all say they'll come back.

299
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,000
他不是那种人  他是个好人  他保证过的
He's not like that. He's a good man. He promised.

300
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,680
他会回来的  波莉阿姨  我知道他会的
He will come back, Aunt Pol, I know he will.

301
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,920
给我安上西班牙马鞍  科利
Get me down a Spanish saddle, Curly.

302
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,980
是  汤姆  西班牙马鞍
Yes, Tom, a Spanish saddle.

303
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,120
它可真漂亮  汤姆  美人儿啊  汤姆
He's a beauty, Tom. Yeah, yeah, a beauty, Tom.

304
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,840
你这匹马真不赖啊  汤姆斯
A fine beast you got there, Thomas.

305
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,580
但真的值得你为此跟李家闹翻吗
But is he worth falling out with the Lee family over?

306
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,500
我只是带个信
Just passing it on...

307
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,980
宣战  整个李氏家族
a declaration of war - the whole Lee clan.

308
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,710
先是枪  现在又是这个
The guns and now this.

309
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,930
千万不要在任何场合提枪
The guns are not spoken of.

310
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,990
明白吗
Right?

311
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,710
汤米
Tommy...

312
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,250
注意点你跟我说话的态度
you mind how you speak to me.

313
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,970
原谅我  叔叔
Forgive me, Uncle.

314
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,560
汤姆斯·谢尔比要跟全世界作对  是吗
It's Thomas Shelby against the whole bloody world, right?

315
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,660
放轻松
Easy...

316
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,750
放松  放松
Easy, easy.

317
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,210
冷静点  小子
Easy, boy.

318
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,950
我们以前在法国时常说
In France we used to say...

319
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,910
我们以前在法国时常说
In France we used to say

320
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,320
只是音乐厅的乐队来了
it's just the music hall band turning up.

321
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,210
是长号和大号的声音  不过如此
It's just trombones and tubas, that's all.

322
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,470
噪音罢了
It's just noise.

323
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,640
噪音罢了  只是点噪音而已
It's just noise. Hey. It's just noise.

324
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,180
你得学会适应
You get used to it.

325
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,100
噪音而已  好孩子  乖孩子
It's just noise. Good boy. Good boy.

326
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,920
你脚掌疼是吗  小子
You have some pain there, boy, hey?

327
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,060
我很抱歉  谢尔比先生
I'm so sorry, Mr Shelby.

328
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,130
顺便说一下  我叫格蕾丝
I'm Grace, by the way.

329
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,580
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

330
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
它叫什么名字
What's his name?

331
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,250
它还没名字呢
He doesn't have a name.

332
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,720
可怜的孩子  该给它取个名字
Poor boy deserves a name.

333
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,740
你有事要跟我说吗
You have something to say to me?

334
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,780
那天晚上你到酒吧的时候  我在唱歌
The other night you came into the pub and I was singing...

335
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,010
你说这里不允许唱歌
You said singing wasn't allowed.

336
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,520
我希望每周能有一个晚上允许唱歌
I'd like there to be one night a week when there's singing.

337
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,040
我觉得那对大家都好
I think it would be good for everyone...

338
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,870
每周六晚上
Saturday nights.

339
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,820
哈里不敢问你  所以
Harry was too afraid to ask you, so...

340
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,210
但你不怕
But you're not.

341
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,710
我也怕
I am.

342
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,780
但我热爱唱歌
But I love to sing.

343
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,070
你的口气听上去像是
You sound like one of those rich girls

344
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,950
那些从都柏林来参加赛马会的富家小姐
who comes over from Dublin for the races.

345
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,260
你喜欢马吗
Do you like horses?

346
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,630
你想挣点外快吗
How do you fancy earning some extra money?

347
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,960
怎么挣
Doing what?

348
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,410
找件漂亮的礼服
Dig out a nice dress.

349
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,120
我带你去赛马会
I want to take you to the races.

350
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,610
摩纳根小子  一赔二

351

在比赛开始前下注吧

352
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,020
我们的赔率有点小变动  约翰
We've got a couple of changes coming in, John.

353
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,890
"石轮渡"跌到八了
Rock Ferry down to eight.

354
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,070

- Down to tens. - That's right.

359

360
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,860
好的朋友  我买摩纳根小子
OK, friend, Monaghan Boy.

361
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,150
要全部倒出来吗  老兄
You want to push out, mate,

362
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,300
比赛就快开始了

363
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,760
很好  找你35磅
Good one. Change of 35 pounds...

364
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,080
我告诉过你  抱歉  谢尔比先生
I've told you... Sorry, Mr Shelby.

365
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,530

370
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,300

Tommy, they are all here for Monaghan Boy.

373
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
我就爱听这个  约翰尼小子
That's what I like to hear, Johnny Boy.

374

波莉阿姨想见你

375
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,720
告诉我那个男人是谁  艾达

鲁道夫·瓦伦蒂诺[影星]

377
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,470

379
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,520
我说  把那个狗日的名字告诉我
I said, tell me his fucking name.

380
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,850
该死的弗莱迪·索恩
Freddie fucking Thorne!

381
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,970
没错
Yeah.

382
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,840
你的同窗好友
Your best mate since school!

383
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,460
那个在法国救你一命的男人
The man who saved your life in France!

384
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,850
去吧
So go on!

385
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,100
去吧  砍死他
Go on, cut him!

386
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,940
把他绞碎抛尸去吧
Cut him up and chuck him in the cut.

387
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,390
喂  我也是谢尔比家的人
Oi! I'm a Shelby too, you know.

388
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,820
给我他妈的继续放电影
Put my fucking film back on!

389
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,580
摩纳根小子终于输了
So Monaghan Boy finally lost.

390
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,310
第三次就是最不幸的
Third time unlucky.

391
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,100
我们把整个城市的钱都席卷来了
We took money from all over the city.

392
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,550
是啊  但你得把附近街坊的钱送回去
Yeah, but you'll pay it back to people round here.

393
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,600
买回你的声望
Buy your popularity back.

394
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,220
已经做了
Already done.

395
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,990
我把你教得很好啊
I taught you well.

396
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,700
没得到比利·肯波的允许你就操控赛马
And you fixed this race without the permission of Billy Kimber.

397
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,610
很显然  我把你教得还不够好
Obviously, I didn't teach you well enough.

398
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,050
第一条规矩  不要挑战远超自己实力的人
Rule one, you don't punch above your weight.

399
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,060
比利·肯波我们是可以对付的
Billy Kimber is there for the taking...

400
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,090
谁说的  汤米和他手下的散兵游勇吗
Says who? Says Tommy and his parliament of one.

401
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,070
我掌管了5年的家族事业
I ran this business for five years...

402
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,690
是啊  我出国打仗去了  记住
Yeah, while I was away fighting, remember,

403
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,610
我在战场上可是学到一些东西的  比如
where I learnt some things, such as

404
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,690
敌弱我攻
you strike when your enemy is weak.

405
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,900
我以为你过来是为了谈家事呢
I thought you came here to talk family business.

406
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,190
我来处理
I'll deal with it.

407
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,120
-你一心忙于掌控全世界  -波莉
- You're too busy taking over the world... - Polly...

408
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,420
如果是关于艾达的事  我需要知道
If it's about Ada, I need to know.

409
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,450
艾达让你把这封信交给弗莱迪
Ada wants you to give Freddie this letter.

410
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,080
她想告诉弗莱迪她怀孕了
She wants Freddie to know she's having his baby.

411
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,310
他需要一个机会来做正确的事
He deserves an opportunity to do the right thing.

412
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,980
我觉得我们该给他们一个机会
I say we give them a chance.

413
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,290
作为一个爱情之路坎坷痛苦的女人
For a woman who's had a hard life with men,

414
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,720
你仍然充满着浪漫情怀  是吧
you're still full of romance, eh?

415
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,450
你觉得弗莱迪看上我们艾达哪点了
What do you think Freddie sees in our Ada?

416
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,960
-那是弗莱迪的事  -不
- That's Freddie's business... - No.

417
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,080
不  我来告诉你答案
No. I'll tell you what he sees.

418
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,230
他看上的是机枪  来福枪  军火
He sees machine guns, and rifles, and ammunition,

419
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,020
和什么狗屁的光荣革命
and some glorious revolution.

420
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,140
你究竟不喜欢弗莱迪哪点
What is it you really don't like about Freddie?

421
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,970
她跟着亡命徒是不会幸福的
She'll have no life with a man on the run.

422
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,730
如果你看不明白这一点  
If you can't see that,

423
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,070
你就很难看清一切的事
you can't see much.

424
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,100
该死的  他们在法国究竟对你做了什么
Damn them for what they did to you in France.

425
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,860
告诉艾达  弗莱迪去美国了
Tell Ada Freddie went to America.

426
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,840
或者俄罗斯也行
Or Russia.

427
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,180
波莉  让艾达一个人把孩子生下来
Polly, it would do no good for Ada

428
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,140
对她没有任何好处
to bring a baby into the world alone.

429
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,510
波莉  听我说
Pol, listen.

430
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,860
事实上  你之所以没用那个东西打我
The truth is you would have hit me with that thing

431
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,200
就因为你心里很清楚我说的是对的
if it weren't for the fact that you know I'm right.

432
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,040
我好像听到有人敲门
I thought I heard someone knocking.

433
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,690
然后就睡不着了
Couldn't get back to sleep.

434
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,050
你拖得越久
The longer you leave it...

435
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,590
结果就越糟糕
the worse it gets.

436
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,380
相信我
Believe me...

437
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
我了解的
I know.

438
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,400
我当年才16岁
I was 16.

439
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,110
不敢告诉任何人
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

440
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,840
波莉  弗莱迪会回来的
Polly, Freddie will come back...

441
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,700
最后是我自己下的手
In the end I did it myself.

442
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,490
我亲手打掉了孩子
I did it to myself...

443
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,750
我差点就死了
and I almost died.

444
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,620
他没回来
And he didn't come back.

445
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,290
他们都不会回来的  他们干嘛要回来
They don't. Why should they?

446
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,700
你知道人们会怎么说
You know the words.

447
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,120
你是个婊子
You're a whore,

448
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,780
孩子是私生子
the baby's a bastard...

449
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,860
但远走高飞的男人却不会受到谴责
but there's no word for the man who doesn't come back.

450
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,640
总有一天
One day...

451
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,130
在你的婚礼上
on your wedding day...

452
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,210
你会手挽着一个好男人
you'll have a good man on your arm...

453
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,990
然后你会说  "波莉
and you'll say, "Polly...

454
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,470
谢谢你当时点醒我"
"Thank you for common sense."

455
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,190
卡迪夫那边有个女人
This woman is in Cardiff.

456
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,180
我们明天坐火车去找她
We'll take the train tomorrow.

457
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,360
事后去城堡玩玩
Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.

458
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,320
我选这个地方是因为这里在你我的辖区之外
I chose this place because it is outside both our jurisdictions.

459
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,440
你想喝茶吗
Do you want tea?

460
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,880
总督察  我应邀前来
Inspector, I responded to your invitation

461
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,050
是为了达成共识
because I want us to understand each other.

462
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,910
我是个生意人
I am a businessman.

463
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,130
我希望我的生意兴隆
I want to make my business successful.

464
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,550
而我希望我的城市和平安宁
And I want my city to run peacefully.

465
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,760
只有城市和平  生意才能兴旺
Well, if the city is peaceful, business can thrive.

466
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,420
这么说我们目标一致
So we are on the same side?

467
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,440
我觉得或许是的
I think perhaps we could be.

468
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,560
但有这种东西存在  我们怎么达成一致
How can we be on the same side when I see things like this?

469
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,480
我的人在一个
My men found this

470
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,130
共产主义分子的卧室里找到的
in the bedroom of a known communist.

471
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,230
上面有你妹妹的名字
It has your sister's name on it.

472
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,890
很明显她和他同床了
It was obvious she had been sleeping in his bed.

473
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,590
你和共产主义分子也同床共梦吗  
Are you also in bed with the communists,

474
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,840
谢尔比先生
Mr Shelby?

475
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,390
我不相信他们的白日梦
I do not share their fantasy.

476
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,310
至于我妹妹的事  我已经处理好了
And, as for my sister, I have already dealt with the situation.

477
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,830
我名单上的第一个人就是弗莱迪·索恩  
Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.

478
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,030
划掉他吧
So cross him off.

479
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,800
他不会再回这个城市了
He won't be returning to the city.

480
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,400
我把他纳入我们的交易条件
I'll make him part of our deal.

481
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,550
什么"交易"
What "Deal"?

482
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,820
你和你的特派员今后不得干涉我的生意
You and your Specials will leave my businesses alone from now on.

483
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,950
不准搜查我们的地盘  不准砸我们的酒吧
No more raids into our territory, no more smashing up pubs

484
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,640
不准查缴我的走私船
and no more lifting my runners.

485
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,900
你必须无视我所有的赌博活动
You will turn a blind eye to all my gambling operations.

486
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,560
而且我准备扩张
Also, I am planning an expansion.

487
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,230
进军赌马生意
Onto the racetracks.

488
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,470
我准备和比利·肯波合作
I intend to do business with Billy Kimber.

489
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,100
他经营着伦敦以外大部分的合法赌马
He runs most of the legal track-side betting outside of London.

490
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,740
他在警队有人
He has policemen on his payroll.

491
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,040
我要你帮我
I want you to put in a word

492
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,140
给格洛斯特郡的总督察传句话
with the Chief Inspector Gloucestershire

493
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,120
让他不要干涉我的行动
that his men should leave me alone when I make my move.

494
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,840
抱歉
Forgive me.

495
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,510
我没带笔
I don't seem to have a pen

496
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,620
记不下这么多要求
to write down this rather long list of demands.

497
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,140
我能得到什么好处
And what do I get in return?

498
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,680
我有你在找的东西
I have what you're looking for.

499
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,720
那些枪在我手上
I have the guns.

500
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,620
什么枪
What guns?

501
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,020
-我不是来玩游戏的  -留步
- I'm not here to play games... - Wait, wait.

502
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,480
25挺刘易斯机枪
25 Lewis machine guns,

503
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,990
50把半自动步枪  10000盒弹药
50 carbines, 10,000 rounds of ammunition -

504
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,320
全装在板条箱里  准备送往利比亚
all in a crate bound for Libya,

505
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,180
从伯明翰轻兵器工厂的打样车间被偷
stolen from the BSA factory proofing bay.

506
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,780
我猜他们派你来伯明翰是为了找回那些枪
I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham to get those guns back.

507
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,940
枪在我这里
Well, it's me that has them.

508
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,700
我已给信任的人交代过  
I have left word with men I trust

509
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,840
如果我因某种原因被警察拘禁
that if I am taken into police custody for whatever reason,

510
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,150
那些枪将被载至利物浦
those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

511
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,850
然后直接运到贝尔法斯特
From there they will be sent directly to Belfast

512
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,770
卖给爱尔兰共和军
and sold to the Irish Republican Army.

513
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,420
你们在爱尔兰的努力将化为乌有
All your good work in Ireland would be undone.

514
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,350
被偷的枪支上都有序列号和标记
Each stolen weapon is numbered and marked.

515
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,430
如果我卖给爱尔兰共和军  要不了多久
If I sell them to the IRA, it won't be long

516
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,360
丘吉尔先生就会发现
before Mr Churchill finds out.

517
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,650
我想光是焚烧国王画像的事
I imagine you got into enough trouble over

518
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,590
已经让你焦头烂额了吧
the burning of the King's photographs.

519
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,160
那只是小试牛刀
That was just a taster.

520
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,940
如果那些枪抵达了贝尔法斯特
If those guns reach Belfast,

521
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,350
你的警界生涯就结束了
your life in the force is over.

522
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,460
当我达到自己的目的后
When I have achieved what I have set out to achieve,

523
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,780
我会告诉你枪藏在哪
I will let you know where to find the guns.

524
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,830
你会成为英雄  说不定会获得勋章
You'll be a hero. You'll probably get a medal.

525
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,580
我做事公允
I'm a fair man.

526
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,190
这个提议也很公平
It's a fair offer.

527
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,730
成交吗
Do we have a deal?

528
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,030
我需要答案
I need an answer.

529
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,570
现在就要
Right now.

530
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,770
好吧
Very well.

531
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,710
但我不想握手以示成交
But I'd prefer if we don't shake hands on it.

532
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,360
我怎么会和一个
Now why would I shake the hand of a man

533
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,850
没为国家奋战过的人握手呢
who didn't even fight for his country?

534
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,910
格蕾丝
Grace.

535
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,020
我有新信息
I have new information.

536
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,080
汤玛斯·谢尔比现在是
'Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,

537
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,410
你任务的全部内容
the middle' and the end of your mission.

538
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,830
我该做什么
So what shall I do?

539
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,370
我也很心痛  就像一个父亲
It hurts me as much as it would a father

540
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,310
亲手将女儿送进窑子一样  但是
sending his own daughter into a whorehouse but...

541
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,770
不管有多不堪  
no matter how repugnant it may be,

542
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:42,500
你都必须不择手段地接近他  然后
you must do everything you can to get close to him and...

543
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,770
查出枪藏在哪里
find out where the guns are hidden.

544
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,020
当然了  我所说的"不择手段"不包括...
Of course, when I say everything, I don't mean...

545
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,330
你完全低估了我
You underestimate me in every way.

546
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,840
给
Here.

547
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,750
你现在代表国王进行军事行动
'You are now active in a military operation' on behalf of the Crown.

548
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,420
我真希望这个人不是你
I wish to God circumstance hadn't chosen you.

549
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,700
我受训练就是为了这个
It's what I'm trained for.

550
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,630
我上班要晚了
I'm late for my shift.

551
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,190
格蕾丝
Grace...

552
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,740
我心与你同在
my heart is with you.

553
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,270
汤玛斯  汤玛斯
Tom. Tom!

554
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,500
汤玛斯  快来  汤玛斯
Tom, you better come quick. Tom!

555
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,280
科利  怎么回事
Curly, tell me.

556
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,110
这是个诅咒  汤玛斯
It's a curse, Tom.

557
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,910
科利  科利
Curly, Curly,

558
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,670
科利  科利
Curly, Curly.

559
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,790
告诉我
Tell me.

560
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,290
告诉我  科利  你的马出什么事了
Tell me, Curly, what's wrong with your horse?

561
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,060
你在集市上买下它时情况就不好
You bought her at the fair in bad feeling.

562
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,870
李氏家族的人在马蹄掌中埋下了恶毒的种子
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof,

563
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,920
让一个老妇人下了咒
got an old woman to put a spell...

564
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,080
所以李氏家族那些混蛋诅咒了它
So those Lee bastards cursed her.

565
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,990
不管是什么  他说反正会传染给另外的脚
Whatever it is, he says it's spread to the other feet.

566
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,530
我敢说明天感染就要直达心脏了
It's going to his heart by tomorrow, I'd say.

567
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,970
我见过两次这种诅咒  
Seen curses like this twice.

568
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,250
根本没办法撤销  汤姆  做不到
Can't take them back, Tom. No.

569
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,920
我告诉过你  汤米
I told you, Tommy.

570
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,910
流淌着黑色血液的吉普赛人是最惹不起的敌人
Better enemies to have than black-blood Gypsies.

571
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,390
出去
Get out.

572
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,450
出去  科利
Get out, Curly.

573
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,640
对不起
I'm sorry.

574
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,580
我们打烊了  谢尔比先生
We're closed, Mr Shelby.

575
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,590
给我一杯酒
Just get me a drink.

576
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,790
我该让您一个人待着吗
Should I leave you alone?

577
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,220
我是来找人作陪的
I came here for company.

578
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,640
哈里去哪儿了
Where's Harry?

579
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,790
他今晚不值班
He took the night off.

580
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,940
他去看电影了
He went to the pictures.

581
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,840
你那匹美丽的宝马怎么样了
How's your beautiful horse?

582
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,770
我刚刚一枪结束了它的生命
I just put a bullet in his head.

583
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,140
它表现太差劲了吗
Was he lame?

584
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,520
它看我的眼神不对
He looked at me the wrong way.

585
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,250
看汤米·谢尔比的眼神不对  下场是很悲惨的
It's not a good idea to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

586
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,260
-真可惜了  -是啊
- What a waste. - Yeah.

587
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,770
确实很可惜
A waste is what it is.

588
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,920
其实  在法国
You know, in France...

589
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,340
在法国时  我已经习惯了见人死亡
In France, I got used to seeing men die.

590
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,420
我却从没习惯见到马死亡
I never got used to seeing horses die.

591
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,830
它们的死相很惨
They die badly.

592
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,080
我按照你的要求找出了一件礼服
I dug out a dress like you asked.

593
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,210
谢谢
Thanks.

594
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,520
你说的是切尔滕纳姆赛马场对吧
Is it Cheltenham you're talking about?

595
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,240
切尔滕纳姆那边的盛会  对吧
Cheltenham's a grand affair, is it not?

596
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,350
国王也会出席的
The King will be there.

597
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,700
乔治国王吗
King George?

598
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,750
不是
No.

599
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,740
是比利·肯波国王
King Billy Kimber...

600
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,220
和他全部的手下
and all his men.

601
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,200
我需要做什么
And what must I do?

602
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,210
给你两英镑  你要对我言听计从
For two pounds, you'll do what I ask you to do.

603
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,220
我要三英镑
I want three.

604
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,540
如果我是要见一个国王  我可不能穿廉价的礼服
If I'm meeting a King, I won't be wearing a cheap dress.

605
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,510
我要求你允许我唱歌
And I asked you to let me sing.

606
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,580
那也是条件之一
That's part of the deal now too.

607
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,070
什么时候成条件了
Since when?

608
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,960
从你差点露出笑容那一刻起
Since you nearly smiled.

609
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,100
周六晚上  气氛轻松
Saturday nights, open and easy.

610
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,630
每个人都可以唱自己想唱的歌  
Everyone gets to sing their song

611
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,040
就像我们在都柏林时一样
just like we did in Dublin.

612
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,720
你从没在都柏林工作过
You never worked in Dublin...

613
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:53,740
别再骗我了
so don't lie to me.

614
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,120
我打听过你说你曾经工作过的酒吧
I asked around about that pub you said you used to work in.

615
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,240
我在那边是有朋友的
I have friends over there.

616
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,870
没人听说过你
No-one has heard of you.

617
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,850
我猜
My guess is...

618
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:16,010
你曾出身于上层家庭  却不小心怀了孕
you're a girl from a good family who got herself pregnant.

619
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,380
我不喜欢别人知道这种事
It's not something I want known.

620
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,600
独自生下孩子完全毁了你的生活
And bringing a child into the world alone ruined your life.

621
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,010
对吗
Right?

622
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,430
所以我是对的
So I'm right...

623
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,880
波莉是错的
and Polly is wrong.

624
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,200
什么对的
Right about what?

625
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,410
那不重要
It doesn't matter.

626
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,880
似乎对你很重要
It looks like it matters to you.

627
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,530
家事罢了
Family business.

628
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,040
你不会对别人说我的事吧
You won't tell anyone my secret.

629
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,520
你以为我会对任何人说任何事吗
Do you think I tell people things?

630
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,040
你会唱什么歌
So what do you sing?

631
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,390
-你想听什么都可以  -好吧
- Anything you want. - Right.

632
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,700
站到椅子上去
Get up on a chair.

633
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,750
欢乐的歌还是悲伤的歌
Happy or sad?

634
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,380
悲伤的
Sad.

635
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,920
好的
Ok.

636
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,570
但我想提醒你  我会让你心碎的
But I warn you, I'll break your heart.

637
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,270
我心已碎
Already broken.

638
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:41,580
*在一个叫做贝尔法斯特的小镇*
*In a neat little town they call Belfast*

639
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,070
*我曾在那里做学徒*
*Apprentice to trade I was bound*

640
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:57,800
*我曾在那美丽的小镇  度过很多快乐时光*
*Many an hour's sweet happiness. Had I spent in that neat little town

641
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,290
*有一天我遭遇不幸*
*A sad misfortune came over me*

642
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,840
*让我远离了那片土地*
*Which caused me to stray from the land

643
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:17,820
*远离我的朋友和亲人*
*Far away from my friends and relations*

644
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:25,660
*被黑色绒缎带背叛*
*Betrayed by the black velvet band*

645
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,260
*她的眼睛  闪耀着钻石般的光芒*
*Her eyes, they shone like diamonds*

646
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,810
*我以为她是这片土地的女王*
*I thought her the queen of the land*

647
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:43,040
*她的秀发  披在肩上*
*And her hair, it hung over her shoulder*

648
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:49,920
*用一根黑色绒缎带扎起*
*Tied up with a black velvet band.*

649
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,410
-你还好吧  -嗯  我没事
- You OK? - Yeah, I'm fine.

650
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,870
我觉得那边会有马车
I think there are some carriages over there

651
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,370
肯定会是空的  但是
that are going to be empty but...

652
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,810
天啊
Jesus.

653
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,310
弗莱迪
Freddie?

654
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,720
你回来了
You came back?

655
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:26,880
有人向我通风报信了
I got a tip-off.

656
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,840
弗莱迪  汤米会杀了你的
Freddie, Tommy will kill you.

657
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,590
就是汤米给我通风报信的
It was Tommy who tipped me off.

658
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,060
或许他还是有点人性的
Maybe he's got half a heart after all.

659
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,750
汤米给我送了一条信息
Tommy got a message to me.

660
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,380
上面写着"离开这里  带上她一起走"
It said "Get out of town and take her with you."

661
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,220
所以
So...

662
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,420
艾达·谢尔比
Ada Shelby...

663
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,860
你愿意嫁给我吗
will you marry me?

664
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,490
我愿意
Yes.

665
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,520
我愿意
Yes.

666
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,360
我愿意
Yes.

667
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,740
好了  快登上火车  赶紧离开这里
Right, get on that bloody train and get out of here.

668
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,490
-快点  你们两个  -弗莱迪  快来啊
- Come on, both of you. - Freddie, come on.

669
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,550
弗莱迪  卡迪夫那边很安全
Freddie, Cardiff's OK.

670
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,310
只要不是这儿  在哪儿都安全
Anywhere but here's OK.

671
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,660
我们哪儿都不去  艾达
We're not going anywhere, Ada!

672
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,070
我们要留在这里  在这儿结婚
We're going to stay here and we're going to marry here.

673
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,990
我不怕汤米·谢尔比
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby!

674
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,860
*让我看看你的微笑*
*Give me your smile*

675
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,910
*你眼里闪动的爱火*
*The love light in your eyes*

676
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,980
把牌洗一洗  
Shuffle these cards...

677
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,950
去跟芬恩玩响指游戏去吧
Go and play snap with Finn.

678
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,700
你也想要威士忌吗
Did you want whiskey as well?

679
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,020
不  啤酒就好
No, just beer.

680
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,930
为什么不喝威士忌  汤米  
Why no whiskey, Tommy?

681
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,390
你觉得待会儿会出乱子吗
Are you expecting trouble?

682
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,540
天啊  汤米  你何苦允许他们唱歌
Jesus Christ, Tommy, what the hell made you let them sing?

683
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,220
他们唱的就像是在勒死猫一样
They sound like they're strangling cats out there.

684
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,480
好了  二十底注  来吧
All right, 20 to play. Come on.

685
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,370
你为什么改变主意了  汤米
What did make you change your mind though, Tommy?

686
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,810
是啊  现在也该是时候了  汤米
Yeah, I mean, it's about time, Tommy.

687
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,960
干什么的时候
Time for what?

688
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,210
你该找个女人的时候
Time you took yourself a woman.

689
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,130
玩你的牌去吧
Just play the bloody hands.

690
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,550
你再继续这样下去  汤米 
You stay the way you are, Tommy.

691
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,280
记住老爸曾经常说的话
Remember what Dad used to say-

692
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,450
"快换的女人  慢跑的马
"Fast women and slow horses...

693
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,610
毁你一生没商量"
"..Will ruin your life."

694
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,490
警察来了
Coppers.

695
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,830
不是
No.

696
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,560
*快来  乔瑟芬  来我的飞行器里*
*Come, Josephine, in my flying machine*

697
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,930
*她飞上天去*
*Up she goes*

698
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,260
*像鸟一样掌握着平衡*
*Balance yourself like a bird...*

699
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:10,150
我操
Holy shit.

700
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,040
是比利·肯波
It's Billy Kimber.

701
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,550
这里有个叫谢尔比的人吗
Is there any man here named Shelby?

702
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:35,100
我问  这里有个叫谢尔比的人吗
I said, is there any man here named Shelby?

703
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,980
哈里  给这些人上酒
Harry, get these men a drink.

704
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,850
其他人都回家吧
Everyone else, go home.

705
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,320
你  也回家
You, go home.

706
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,160
-但芬顿先生说  -我说让你回家去
- But Mr Fenton said... - I said go home.

707
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,410
我从没赞许过在酒吧里做工的女人
I've never approved of women in pubs

708
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,870
但长成这样的
but when they look like that...

709
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,330
你刚刚说要找叫谢尔比的人
You said you wanted men called Shelby.

710
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,810
我们这儿有三个
You've got three of them.

711
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,190
好吧  我本来从来没听说过你 
Right, I'd never heard of you,

712
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,810
但后来确实听说了
then I did hear of you,

713
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,560
组成了什么剃刀党  我就心想  那又怎样
some little Didicoy razor gang. I thought to myself, so what?

714
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,180
但之后你们狠狠坑了我一把
But then you fuck me over

715
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,300
所以现在你们吸引了我全部的注意力
so now you have my undivided attention.

716
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,940
顺便问一句  我该跟谁谈  谁是老大
By the way, which one am I talking to? Who's the boss?

717
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,430
我是最年长的
Well, I'm the oldest.

718
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,430
显然嘛
Clearly.

719
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,620
你是在嘲笑我哥哥吗
Are you laughing at my brother?

720
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,930
好了  他是最年长的  你是最愚蠢的
Right, he's the oldest, you're the thickest.

721
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:45,610
我听说你们的老大叫汤米  我猜就是你了吧
I'm told the boss is called Tommy and I'm guessing that's you

722
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,770
因为你不停地上下打量我  
cos you're looking me up and down

723
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,400
就像我是个妓女一样
like I'm a fucking tart.

724
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,130
我想知道你要怎么样
I want to know what you want.

725
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,820
坎普敦赛马场出现了可疑的赌马模式
There were suspicious betting patterns at Kempton Park.

726
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,430
事关一匹叫做摩纳根小子的马
A horse called Monaghan Boy.

727
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,370
它前两次大举获胜  第三次却倒数第一
He won by a length twice and then finished last

728
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,900
当时压在它身上的赌资有3000英镑
with 3,000 pounds bet on him.

729
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,630
我该跟谁谈才对
Which one am I talking to?

730
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,930
你们两个哪个才是老大
Which one of you is the boss?

731
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,760
我是肯波先生的顾问和会计师
I am Mr Kimber's advisor and accountant.

732
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,710
我才是老大  明白吗
And I'm the fucking boss, OK?

733
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,070
好了  没什么好谈判的了  
Right, end of parley,

734
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,580
你们没经过我的允许操纵了比赛
you fixed a race without my permission.

735
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:20,750
你们这些吉普赛狗杂种  用诡计骗取了加里森街
You fucking Gypsy scum what live off the war pensions

736
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,220
那些可怜的寡妇们得到的战争抚恤金
of these poor old Garrison Lane widows!

737
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,540
那是你们才干的下贱的事
That's your level!

738
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,020
我是比利·肯波  我运营的是赛马生意
I am Billy Kimber, I run the races

739
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,320
你们竟敢操纵一场比赛
and you fixed one of them

740
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,910
我一定要让你们死无葬身之地
so I'm going to have you shot against a post.

741
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,540
肯波先生
Mr Kimber.

742
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,170
你看看
Look at it.

743
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,680
上面刻的是我的名字
That is my name on it.

744
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,360
是李氏家族的人干的
It's from the Lee family.

745
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,490
你也在和他们交战  对吧  肯波先生
You are also at war with the Lees, Mr Kimber, am I right?

746
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,150
李氏家族的人袭击了你的赌马生意 
The Lees are attacking your bookies

747
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,220
抢走了你的钱
and taking your money.

748
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,980
你手下的人无法控制他们
Your men can't control them.

749
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,760
你需要帮助
You need help.

750
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,160
或许我们该听听谢尔比先生有什么话想说
Perhaps we should listen to what Mr Shelby has to say.

751
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,780
然后再做决定
Before we make our decisions.

752
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,840
好吧  李氏家族的人在集市上闲言碎语很多
Right, the Lees are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.

753
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,130
他们的亲族很多
They have a lot of kin.

754
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,390
他们说赛马生意是容易到手的肥肉
They're saying the racetracks are easy meat

755
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,350
因为警察在忙着应付罢工事件
because the police are busy with strikes.

756
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,660
现在  我们有了共同的联系 
Now, we have connections.

757
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,210
我们知道他们的运作方式
We know how they operate.

758
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,950
你有大把的人手
You have muscle.

759
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,550
我们合力可以打垮他们  
Together we can beat them.

760
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,390
但分而作战  就不一定了
Divided, maybe not.

761
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:34,520
肯波先生  或许我们该花点时间仔细考虑一下
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take some time for reflection.

762
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,950
或许再安排第二次会面
Possibly make arrangements for a second meeting.

763
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,240
我很崇敬你  肯波先生
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

764
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,220
你白手起家  建立了合法的生意
You started with nothing and built a legitimate business.

765
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,130
如果能跟你合作真的很荣幸  肯波先生
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.

766
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,210
没人可以跟我合作
Nobody works with me.

767
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,660
都只能在我手下工作
People work for me.

768
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,020
捡起来吧  吉普赛小子
Pick it up, pikey.

769
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,630
坐  坐下
Sit. Sit down.

770
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,050
那是给你修补天花板的钱
That's for your ceiling.

771
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,270
谢谢你  肯波先生
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

772
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:32,970
我们会去切尔滕纳姆的
We will be at Cheltenham.

773
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,870
我也会去的
As will I.

774
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,790
所以你是故意跟李氏家族那些人干架的
So you picked a fight with the Lees on purpose.

775
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,870
汤米  我们不能惹狗日的比利·肯波
Tommy, we can't mess with Billy fucking Kimber.

776
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,170
去把你的头发理得好看一点  老哥
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

777
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,220
我们要去赛马场了
We're going to the races.
