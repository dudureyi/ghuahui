多少鲜血洒在了佛兰德斯

No, but these past few days I've been speculating.

109
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,840
思考什么
About what?

110
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,320
我一位工会的同志有个姐妹
One of my Union comrades has a sister,

111
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,200
她在伯明翰轻兵器工厂的电报局工作

温斯顿·丘吉尔亲自从伦敦发给高层的电报
coming up from London to the brass from Winston Churchill himself.

114
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,960
是关于一起劫案的
Something about a robbery.

115
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,560
上面说是"举国震惊的劫案"
"A robbery of national significance", it said.

116
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,440
她在电报机上发现了一个名单
She found the list of names left on the telegraph machine.

117
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,890
那上面有你和我的名字
And on that list was your name and my name together.

118
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,670
什么样的名单上
What kind of a list would have the name

119
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,800
会同时有共产党和赌马徒的名字
of a Communist and the name of a bookmaker side-by-side?

120
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,030
也许上面写的都是给穷人虚假希望的人
Perhaps it's a list of men who give false hope to the poor.

121
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,530

砍人和毒打的恶行
when I hear about the cuttings and beatings

126
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,680
我真希望你在法国挨那一枪
that I really wish I'd let you take that bullet in France.

127
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,830
相信我  有时深夜里我也这么希望
Believe me, there are nights I wish you had.

- They're going to get me! - On three. One, two, three, down!

130
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,160
他们会杀了我
They're going to kill me!

131
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,940

你不在法国
You're not in France.

134
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,640
你不是一枚炮弹  丹尼  你是个人
You're not an artillery shell, Danny, you're a man. Eh?

135
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,100
你不是高速炮弹
You're not a whizz bang.

136
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,840
你是人  丹尼
You're a human being, Danny.

137
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,720
没事了  你已经没事了  没事了
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right.

138
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,680
起来  起来
Up! Up!

139
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,280
没事了  放轻松
It's all right, it's all right.

140
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,400
该死  我又犯毛病了吗
Oh, hell. Did I do it again?

141
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,760
你又犯毛病了  丹尼
You did it again, Danny.

142
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,440
你不能再这样了  伙计
Got to stop doing this, man.

143
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,710
-没事的  -天啊  谢尔比先生
- It's all right. - Oh, God, Mr. Shelby,

144
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,480
我很抱歉
I'm sorry...

145
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,880
没事的  回家陪老婆去吧  丹尼
It's all right. You go home to your wife now, Danny.

146
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,610
别再想那些战场上的事情了
Try and get all that smoke and mud out of your head, eh?

147
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,560
是  谢尔比先生  我很抱歉
Yes, Mr. Shelby. I'm sorry.

148
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
走吧
Go on.

149
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,240
谢尔比先生  你得对他采取点措施了
Mr. Shelby, you have to do something about him.

150
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,800
说的太对了  哈里
Damn right, Harry.

151
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,560
你给剃刀党付了那么多保护费
You pay the Peaky Blinders a lot of money for protection.

152
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,880
你就是这里的法律  汤米  对吗
You're the law around here now, Tommy, aren't you?

153
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,140
或许你该一枪崩了丹尼
Maybe you should put a bullet in Danny Whizz Bang's head

154
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,120
就像他们对待疯马那样
like they do with mad horses.

155
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,440
说不定哪天你也得一枪崩了我呢
Maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday, too.

156
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,880
把账单送到剃刀党  我们会结清的
Bring the bill to the Peaky Blinders. We'll take care of this.

157
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
看看这把枪
Look at the gun.

158
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,800
认出来了吗
Recognise it?

159
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,710
快点给我站起来  你个蠢猪
Get up off your arse, you mumping pig!

160
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,320
波莉阿姨  你他妈这是干什么
Aunt Pol! What the fuck d'you do that for?!

161
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,190
今天下午芬恩在切割机旁边玩这把枪
Finn was playing with this this afternoon by the cutter.

162
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,320
枪当时是上了膛的
It was loaded.

163
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,200
他差点把艾达的胸膛打烂了
He nearly blew Ada's tits off.

164
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,880
肯定是从我兜里掉出来了
It must've fell out of my pocket.

165
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,300
他说他是在赛马投注站的餐柜上发现的
He said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop...

166
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,160
而且还装了子弹
with bullets in it.

167
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,920
那估计我当时是喝高了
Ma... I must've been drunk.

168
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
你什么时候清醒过
When are you not drunk?

169
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,520
波莉阿姨  我很抱歉
Look, Aunt Pol, I'm sorry.

170
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,560
我  我很抱歉
I'm... I'm sorry.

171
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,560
我可以不把这事告诉任何人
We'll keep this between ourselves

172
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,920
前提是你发誓以后不再把枪随处乱放
if you swear not to leave guns lying around.

173
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,920
我知道你独自抚养4个孩子很难
Look, I know having four kids without a woman is hard.

174
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,240
但我也不轻松  快走吧  要迟到了
But my boot's harder. Now, come on, we're late.

175
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,320
好了
Right,

176
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,880
我召集大家来开家族会议
I've called this family meeting

177
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,960
是因为我有重要的事要宣布
because I've got some very important news.

178
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,780
斯卡德伯特和拉夫洛克
Scudboat and Lovelock

179
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,640
昨晚从贝尔法斯特回来了
got back from Belfast last night.

180
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,800
他们买了匹种马来为母马配种
They were buying a stallion to cover their mares.

181
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,560
昨天他们去了夏克尔路上的一家酒吧
They were in a pub on the Shankhill Road yesterday,

182
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,300
结果那家酒吧里有个警察
and in that pub, there was a copper...

183
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,920
正在发这个
handing out these.

184
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,990
"如果你身高超过5英尺  能打架
"If you're over five feet and can fight,

185
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,720
快来伯明翰吧"
come to Birmingham."

186
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,020
他们正在召集新教徒爱尔兰人
They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen

187
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,740
作为特派员来到这里
to come over here as Specials.

188
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,600
-来干什么  -来清理这座城市  艾达
- To do what? - To clean up the city, Ada.

189
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,120
他是总督察
He's a Chief Inspector.

190
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,730
在过去4年里
The last four years,

191
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,210
他一直在贝尔法斯特清理爱尔兰共和军
he's been clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

192
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,200
你怎么知道这么多情况
How do you know so bloody much?

193
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,640
因为我问过被我们收买的警察
Cos I asked the coppers on our payroll.

194
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,160
那你为什么不告诉我
And why didn't you tell me?

195
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,200
我不是正在告诉你吗
I'm telling you.

196
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
那为什么要派他来伯明翰
So why are they sending him to Birmingham?

197
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,520
因为伯明翰轻兵器工厂一直有罢工的情况出现
There's been all these bloody strikes at the BSA...

198
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,480
包括奥斯丁汽车公司
and the Austin works lately.

199
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,220
现在报纸上满版都在谈论暴乱
Now the papers are talking about sedition.

200
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,000
和革命
And revolution.

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
我猜他是要对共产主义分子下手
I reckon it's Communists he's after.

202
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,120
那这个警察是不会来找我们麻烦的  对吧
So this copper's going to leave us alone, right?

203
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,850
格陵兰大道那边有很多爱尔兰人
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes

204
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,800
是为了躲避他而离开贝尔法斯特的
who left Belfast to get away from him.

205
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
他们说有些跟他作对的天主教徒
They say Catholic men who crossed him

206
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,000
到了晚上人就从世上消失了
used to disappear in the night.

207
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,830
是  但我们不是爱尔兰共和军
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.

208
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,810
我们曾经为国王卖命打过仗
We bloody fought for the King.

209
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,380
不管怎样  我们是剃刀党
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.

210
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,980
我们才不会怕什么警察
We're not scared of coppers.

211
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,750
-他说的没错  -如果他们来找我们的麻烦
- He's right. - If they come for us,

212
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,720
我们就把他们的脸割开
we'll cut them a smile each.

213
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,080
那亚瑟
So, Arthur...

214
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,320
-就这样吗  -你怎么想  波莉阿姨
- is that it? - What do you think, Aunt Pol?

215
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,740
我们家族做事从不遮遮掩掩
This family does everything open.

216
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,380
你还有别的要在会上说吗  汤玛斯
You've nothing more to say to this meeting, Thomas?

217
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,040
没了
No.

218
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,440
没有女人什么事
Nothing that's women's business.

219
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,730
你们男人出去打仗的时候
This whole bloody enterprise was women's business

220
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,680
整个黑帮帝国都是靠女人来维系的
while you boys were away at war.

221
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,440
现在有什么变了吗
What's changed?

222
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,400
我们回来了
We came back.

223
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,000
而在最后审判日来临时  上帝会惩罚恶徒
And the Lord will smite the unholy when the great judgment comes.

224
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
而审判即将来临  朋友们
And judgment is coming, my friends.

225
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,880
审判即将降临于这座邪恶之城
Judgment is coming to this wicked city.

226
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,700
而你们那堕落淫乱的行为终将暴露
And your wickedness and your fornication will be revealed.

227
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,640
你们在造物主面前将无所遁形
You cannot hide from the Creator.

228
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,020
你们在神面前将无处躲藏
You cannot hide from the Almighty himself.

229
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,960
造物主能洞悉一切
The Creator sees all.

230
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,720
你们在真主面前将无法遮掩
You cannot hide from the true and living God...

231
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,240
你给我下来
Get off with yer!

232
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,240
滚远点
Fuck off!

233
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,800
就到这了  我不会再往前开了
That's it, I don't go any further.

234
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,910
我只有十分钟时间  你想怎么样
I have ten minutes. What do you want?

235
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,380
一个解释
An explanation.

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,960
我总是能察觉出你对我有所隐瞒
I've always been able to tell when you're hiding something.

237
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,200
周围的人都喜欢蜚短流长
People round here talk.

238
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,800
有人在伯明翰轻武器工厂工作
Some of them work at the BSA.

239
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,520
我和工人的老婆们聊过天
I've been talking to the wives of factory hands.

240
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,680
警探曾去打样车间里问过话
Detectives have been asking questions in the proofing shops.

241
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,360
那家工厂里的所有事都逃不过你的眼睛
Nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it.

242
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,480
快说
Speak.

243
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,600
上帝和波莉阿姨等着听呢
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

244
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,480
本应该是很平常的事
It was meant to be routine.

245
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,680
我有一位伦敦的买家想买几辆摩托车
I had a buyer in London for some... motorcycles.

246
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,670
我就让我的手下去偷
I asked my men to steal me

247
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,220
4辆带汽油发动机的摩托车
four bikes with petrol engines.

248
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,280
我猜他们当时都喝高了
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

249
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,000
工厂里有个蒸馏室  可以制作杜松子酒
There's a still inside the factory makes tram-line gin.

250
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,120
那帮该死的家伙搬错箱子了
They picked up the wrong fucking crate.

251
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,440
他们按原定计划把箱子
The boys dropped it at

252
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,940
放在了查理·斯特朗家的院子里
Charlie Strong's yard as agreed.

253
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,860
他们肯定是从打样车间偷出来的
They must've taken it from the proofing bay

254
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,700
而不是从出口车间
instead of the export bay.

255
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,640
我的亲娘啊
Holy sweet baby of Mary!

256
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
我们在箱子里发现25挺刘易斯机枪
Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns,

257
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,800
10000盒弹药
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

258
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,730
50把半自动步枪
50 semi-automatic rifles,

259
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,040
200把已装填子弹的手枪
200 pistols with shells.

260
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,320
天啊  汤米
Jesus, Tommy!

261
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
本是要送往利比亚的
All bound for Libya.

262
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,440
结果却到了查理·斯特朗家的院子里
Sitting right there in Charlie Strong's yard.

263
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
告诉我你把那些扔进切割机处理掉了
Tell me you threw them in the cutter.

264
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
我们把它们存放在马厩里了  以防淋雨
We put 'em in the stables, out of the rain.

265
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,970
那些枪还没上过油
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

266
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,810
所以他们才会从贝尔法斯特派警察过来
So that's why they sent a copper from Belfast.

267
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,790
或许是  或许不是
Maybe, maybe not.

268
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,750
汤玛斯  你经营赌马公司
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,

269
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,530
是个强盗  打手
a robber, a fighting man,

270
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,880
但你不傻
you're not a fool.

271
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,810
你敢把枪卖给任何一个能发挥其用武之地的人
You sell those guns to anyone who has use to 'em,

272
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,480
你就死定了
you will hang!

273
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,720
把它们扔到警察能找到的地方
Dump them somewhere the police can find them.

274
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,010
或许他们发现枪没被不该拿的人拿到
Maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands

275
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,750
此事就能平息了
this might blow over.

276
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,230
让查理今晚就扔掉
Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.

277
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,760
不行  他从不在月圆之夜动违禁品
No. He won't move contraband under a full moon.

278
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,160
得等上3天  月缺之后
Three days until it wanes.

279
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,360
到时你知道该怎么做吧
Then you'll do the right thing?

280
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,190
你继承了你母亲的理智
You have your mother's common sense,

281
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,600
却也继承了你父亲的邪恶
but your father's devilment.

282
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,680
我可以看到二者的激烈交锋
I see them fighting.

283
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,560
让你母亲的品性获胜吧
Let your mother win.

284
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,230
我拿到了佩妮俱乐部的票
I got tickets for the Penny Crush.

285
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,600
今晚要放映汤姆·米克斯的电影[美国演员]
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

286
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,290
我今晚可没心情看电影  艾达
I'm not in the mood for the pictures tonight, Ada.

287
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,670
我可不想再在这里做了
Well, I'm not doing it here again.

288
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,520
我上次被淤泥弄得脏兮兮的
I got covered in mud last time.

289
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,240
我们去散散步吧
Let's just walk a bit.

290
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,680
如果走到格雷特街  我们可以去趟酒吧
If we go down as far as Greet, we could go to a pub.

291
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,420
你的兄弟们在格雷特街有朋友啊
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

292
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,000
他们到处都有朋友  我们得走到伦敦才行啊
They have friends everywhere. We'd have to walk to London.

293
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,050
我跟你在一起
I'm with you

294
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,680
因为你是这里唯一不怕他们的男人
because you're the only man round here not scared of them.

295
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,880
我很怕他们的
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

296
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,680
但你对我的爱胜过对他们的恐惧  对吧
But you love me more than you fear them, right?

297
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,510
我不想老是偷偷摸摸的
I don't want to be always sneaking about.

298
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,560
-快了  我们会告诉他们的  -什么时候
- Soon, we'll tell them. - When?

299
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
家族会议开得怎么样
How did the family meeting go?

300
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,880
-老样子  最近新来了个警察  -我听说了
- Usual. There's a new copper coming. - I heard.

301
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,020
汤米说他要抓你们这一类人
And Tommy says he's after the likes of you.

302
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,080
所以也许你该把你的书烧了  别再搞什么演讲了
So maybe you should burn your books and stop making speeches.

303
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,360
我的艾达
Oh, my Ada.

304
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,840
小希斯王国皇室里唯一的公主
The only princess of the royal family of the Kingdom of Small Heath.

305
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,600
我只是个多嘴的共产主义穷小子
I'm just a poor communist frog with a big mouth.

306
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,520
赐我个吻吧  艾达公主
Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.

307
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,160
我是来应聘酒吧女侍的
I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

308
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,440
-你疯了吗  -我怎么了
- Are you mad? - Am I what?

309
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,280
-你知道这是什么地方吗  -我在广告上看到的
- Do you know about this place? - I saw it in an advertisement.

310
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,080
-人已经找到了  -昨天的报纸上才登的广告
- Job's been filled. - It was in yesterday's paper.

311
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,310
相信我  亲爱的  我这是在帮你
Believe me, love, I'm doing you a favour.

312
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,470
我不需要你帮忙  我只需要份工作
I'm not asking for favours. I'm asking for employment.

313
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,680
你太...正派了

314
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,200
-你怎么知道  -也太漂亮了
- How would you know? - And too pretty.

315
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
他们会把你按在墙上狠干一番的
They'd have you up against a wall.

316
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,880
我有经验  也有介绍信
I have experience and references.

317
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,720
你来自爱尔兰哪里
What part of Ireland are you from?

318
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,830
戈尔韦
Galway.

319
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,560
我以前在都柏林工作
I worked in Dublin.

320
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
我母亲来自戈尔韦

321
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,160

*多希望能回到卡里克弗格斯*

325
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,080

*我愿游过深不见底的大海*

327
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,800
*寻找我的心之所爱*

328

*我年少时的友人和亲人*

329

330
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,400

331
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,110
在爱尔兰

332
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,540
我的歌声让人动容落泪  停止打斗
my singing made them cry and stopped them fighting.

333
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,830
希望你会唱很多歌

334
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,480
婴儿
Babies...

335
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,690
被丢弃在鱼骨蛋壳之间
discarded... with the fish bones and eggshells.

336
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,510
小姑娘们  才11岁
Girls, 11 years old...

337
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,800
老男人花三便士就能随意糟蹋她们
pierced and punctured by old men for thruppence a time!

338
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,360
像禽兽那样发泄欲望
Rutted upon like animals!

339
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,960
堕落
Degradation.

340
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,590
父亲搞上女儿
Fathers with their daughters,

341
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,600
兄弟与姐妹同床共枕

342
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,880
大街上满是乞丐和窃贼
Beggars and thieves left to run in the streets.

343
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,100
街两旁却堆满了伤员
And astride the whole stinking pile

344
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,720
伤口腐烂  散发恶臭
of wounds and rotten flesh...

345
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,040
你们的雇主
Your masters!

346
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,430
你们举手致敬的那些家伙
The men who you touch your cap to.

347
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,240
剃刀党
The Peaky Blinders!

348
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,120
邪恶  残忍的黑帮
The vicious... merciless gangs

349
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,450
他们刺瞎原本明亮的眼睛
who blind those that see

350
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,040
割下那些多嘴之人的舌头
and cut out the tongues of those who talk.

351
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,290
你们比他们更卑劣
You are worse than them!

352
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,300
你们之中有人
Those of you who have

353
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,320
自战争爆发就一直在收受他们的贿赂
taken their bribes these years since the war,

354
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,840
有人故意视而不见
those of you who look the other way,

355
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,360
你们  比他们更卑劣
you... are worse than them!

356
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,090
上帝谴责你们玷污了身上的警服
God damn you for soiling your uniforms!

357
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,640
现在又多了爱尔兰共和军的芬尼亚运动会成员
And then... there are the IRA Fenians

358
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,240
以及共产主义分子
and the Communists.

359
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,880
他们的心更加黑暗
Blacker hearts still.

360
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,380
他们依靠这些腐败求生
They feed on the puss of all this corruption

361
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,330
如同死尸上的蛆虫一般
like maggots in a corpse.

362
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,480
如果任由蛆虫成长壮大
And like maggots, if left to swell

363
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,450
那就最终会变成成群的苍蝇
they will eventually swarm like flies

364
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,200
将他们腐烂的思想
and spread their rotten philosophy

365
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,160
传遍全国  传向世界
across the country and across the world!

366
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,960
如此一来  他们便是我们的敌人
Those then... are our enemies!

367
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,960
一个三头巨怪
A three-headed beast.

368
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,470
我的任务就是  对他们斩草除根  
It is my job to decapitate each one

369
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,450
我向上帝发誓我一定会做到的
and by God I will do it!

370
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,120
我不信任你们中的任何一人
I don't trust any of yous

371
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,800
除非你们赢得我的信任
until you earn my trust!

372
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,000
那可需要一些努力才行
And that takes some earning.

373
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,440
这些是要加入你们队伍的新人
These are the new men who will bolster your ranks.

374
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
都是好人
Good men...

375
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,960
来自虔诚的教徒家庭
from God-fearing families.

376
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,390
太阳下山时
By the time the sun sets,

377
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,400
他们就将宣誓就职  穿上警服
they will be sworn in and in uniform.

378
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,550
明天日出时  他们将走上街头
And by sunrise tomorrow, they will be on the streets.

379
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,760
那些与我们作对的人  自求多福吧
God help those who stand in our way!

380
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,240
抱歉  谢尔比先生
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

381
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,880
-谢尔比先生  -这边请

382
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
瞧瞧  姑娘们
You see, ladies,

383
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,640
跟剃刀党人出来  不用排队
when you're out with a Blinder, you don't have to queue.

384
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,440
好了  在他们把普通人放进来之前
Right... I want a blow job off both of you

385
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,880
我要你们一起来给我吹吹箫
before they let the ordinary people in.

386
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
开始吧  把帽子摘下来
Away you go. Take your hat off.

387
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
什么情况
What the fuck?!

388
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,280
你他妈谁啊
Who the fuck are you?!

389
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,160
我可是牛逼的亚瑟·谢尔比
I'm Arthur-fucking-Shelby!

390
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,240
亚瑟·谢尔比

391
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,670
剃刀党的领头羊
Lead pack dog of the Peaky Blinders.

392
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,440
看着我
Look at me.

393
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
混蛋
Bastard!

394
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,560
你的制服吗
Your uniform?

395
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,720
我明白  确实很吓人
Terrifying, I'm sure.

396
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,620
他有带枪吗  
Did he have a gun?

397
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,280
没有枪  袜子里藏着把刀  腰带上有根短棍
No gun. A knife in his sock, cosh in his belt.

398
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,680
谢尔比先生
Now, Mr Shelby...

399
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,880
我希望你把这当做我对你的自我介绍
I want you to see this as me introducing myself to you.

400
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,920

401
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,530
在这个世界上  唯一让我感兴趣的
In all the world the only thing that interests me

402
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,320
只有真相
is the truth.

403
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,280
你对盗窃案了解多少
what do you know about the robbery?

404
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,040
什么盗窃案
What robbery?

405
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,880
我再问你一遍
I will ask you again.

406
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,680
你对盗窃案  了解多少
What do you know... about the robbery?

407
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,680
我对天发誓  我不知道你在说什么  
I swear to God, I don't know what you're talking about.

408
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,920
他妈的什么盗窃案
What fucking robbery?

409
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,160
我和像你这样的畜生打了35年交道
After 35 years of dealing with animals like you,

410
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,230
我动动鼻子就能知道
I can tell just by sniffing the air...

411
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,480
你是不是在说谎
whether or not you're lying.

412
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,870
我他妈的没骗你  明白吗
I'm not fucking lying! All right?

413
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,720
我他妈的没说谎
I'm not fucking lying!

414
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,080
我知道
I know.

415
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,520
我在你通红的双眼中看不到任何可疑迹象
I see nothing of interest behind the blood in your eyes.

416
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,340
而且你周身的血液  都无法承载
And no blood in your veins that could carry...

417
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,290
任何狡诈的天分
even a trace of cunning or guile.

418
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
但你要明白
But understand this.

419
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,620
我手中掌握的权力
It is well within my power

420
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,160
足以让你和你那人渣家族
to have you and the rest of your scum family

421
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,710
年底之前溺死在运河里
face down in the canal before the year is out.

422
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
另一方面
On the other hand...

423
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,320
我们可以互相帮助
we can help each other.

424
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,900
白天总是这么忙吗
Is it always this busy on a daytime?

425
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,480
不  这些孩子要去圣安德鲁斯
No. These boys are on their way to St Andrews.

426
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,650
-去做祷告吗  -那是不可能的
- To pray? - That'll be the day.

427
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,320
圣安德鲁斯有个足球场
St Andrews is a football ground.

428
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,300
蓝军队在踢比赛
The Blues are playing.

429
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,360
那边坐着的是前锋
That's the forward line there.

430
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,190
信不信由你  那个人是守门员  
And that's the goalie, believe it or not.

431
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,160
给我来瓶朗姆酒
I need a bottle of rum.

432
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,920
格蕾丝  无论点什么  都免费赠送
Grace, whatever it is, it's on the house.

433
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
一整瓶吗  -是的
- A whole bottle? - Yeah.

434
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,200
-白朗姆酒还是黑朗姆酒  -随便
- White or dark rum? - Don't care.

435
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,600
好的老兄  想来点什么  喝两杯吗
Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

436
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,640
谢谢你
Thank you.

437
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,080
哈里说这是酒吧免费赠送的
Harry said it's on the house.

438
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,680
你是妓女吗
Are you a whore?

439
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,880
如果不是的话  你不该在这里
Cos if you're not, you're in the wrong place.

440
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,640
他就是你警告我当心的那些人之一吗
He's one of them you warned me about?

441
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,960
格蕾丝  你为人友善可也得多加小心
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl but be careful.

442
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,660
如果我说费用全免
If I say something's on the house,

443
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,800
无论是谁  都别去攀谈
then say nothing to whoever you're serving.

444
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,770
他们要是看上你了
If they decide that they want you,

445
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,480
任何人都无力挽回
then there's nothing anybody could do about it.

446
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,010
算你幸运  自从汤米从法国回来
Lucky for you, since he got back from France,

447
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,920
就对女人失去了兴趣
Tommy doesn't want anybody at all.

448
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,560
要点什么  老兄
Yes, lads?

449
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,460
约翰  把他眼睛上的血擦干净
John, wipe the blood out of his eye.

450
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,730
什么时候轮到你发号施令了
Since when did you give orders?

451
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,210
我可是受过训练的护士
I'm a trained nurse.

452
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,990
别逗我笑  我一笑就脸疼
Don't make me laugh, it hurts me face.

453
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,010
我真的是啊
I bloody am!

454
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
你只去教堂上过一节急救课
You went to one first-aid class in the church hall

455
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,120
而且因为偷笑被赶出门外
and got thrown out for giggling.

456
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,490
在那之前我已经学会了如何防止人窒息
Not before I learnt how to stop somebody from choking.

457
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,200
我他妈的可没窒息  不是吗
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

458
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,280
等我把这块布缠在你脖子上  你就会了
You will be when I wrap this cloth round your neck.

459
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,560
让我看看他
Let me see him.

460
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,520
好了  喝点酒吧
All right, have this.

461
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,920
把那个给我
Give me that.

462
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,520
没事了
You're all right.

463
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,880
他说是丘吉尔阁下派他来伯明翰的
He said Mr. Churchill sent him to Birmingham.

464
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,720
他说是为了国家利益
National interest, he said.

465
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
跟盗窃案有关
Something about a robbery.

466
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
他想让我们帮他
He said he wants us to help him.

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,510
我们不帮警察
We don't help coppers.

468
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,200
我们在战场上的表现他全知道
He knew all about our war records.

469
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,020
他说我们是爱国者  和他一样
He said we're patriots... like him.

470
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,460
他想让我们做他的耳目
He wants us to be his eyes and ears.

471
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,740
我说
I said...

472
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,060
我说我们得开个家族会议  投票决定
I said we'd have a family meeting and take a vote.

473
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,260
为什么不呢
Well, why not?

474
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,460
我们和芬尼亚运动成员  以及共产党人都不来往
We've no truck with Fenians or Communists.

475
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,180
你是怎么回事
What's wrong with you?

476
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,980
他最近到底是怎么回事
What the fuck is wrong with him lately?!

477
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,650
我要是知道
If I knew,

478
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,780
早就从康普顿的药剂师那里买解药回来了
I'd buy the cure from Compton's Chemists.

479
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,820
*我只是个年轻姑娘*
*I am just a young girl*

480
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,660
*我从远方来*
*I have just come over*

481
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,580
*从那个人们做事轰轰烈烈的国家来*
*Over from the country where they do things big*

482
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,340
*在那些男孩之中*
*And amongst the boys*

483
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,060
*有我的情人*
*I've got myself a lover*

484
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,920
*自从有了他*
*And since I have a lover*

485
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,180
*我无心装扮*
*I don't care a fig*

486
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,980
*我的爱人在长廊中*
*The boy I love is up in the gallery*

487
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:11,660
*我的爱人注视着我*
*The boy I love is... looking at me*

488
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,700
*难道你们看不见他就站在那里*
*Can't you see him standing there*

489
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,240
*挥着他的手帕*
*Waving his handkerchief*

490
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,040
*像知更鸟一般快乐地在树上歌唱*
*As merry as a robin that sings on the tree*

491
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,270
我们从开战以来就没请人唱过歌了
We haven't had singing in here since the war.

492
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,020
你觉得那是为什么  哈里
Why do you think that is, Harry?

493
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,030
亚瑟有没有说
So did Arthur say

494
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,900
新警察给了他什么好处
what kind of deal this new copper offered him?

495
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,980
天啊  你才刚刚射完精
God! The second your balls are empty

496
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,820
就又开始扯政治了
it's back onto politics.

497
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
汤米怎么说
What did Tommy say?

498
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,690
他什么也没说
He didn't say anything.

499
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,940
你知道他那个德行
You know what he's like.

500
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,620
是啊  我知道他的品性
Yeah, I know what he's like.

501
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,020
他喜欢和人激烈地干一架
He likes to take his fights onto the mud.

502
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,900
不喜欢站着等待
Doesn't like to stand and wait.

503
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,620
你知道他要是发现我们的事会怎么做
You know what he'd do if he found out about us.

504
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,140
他尽管放马过来
He could try.

505
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,730
有时候我觉得  你和我在一起
Sometimes, it's like you're with me

506
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,180
只是为了证明你能和我在一起
just to show you can.

507
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,960
总有一天我和汤米会再次站在同一阵营的
One day me and Tommy will be on the same side again.

508
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,580
汤米
Tommy...!

509
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,490
你干什么呢  我们关门了  回家去
Hey, what you do? We're closed. Go home.

510
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,500
回家去  疯子
Go home, crazy man.

511
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,580
我叫你回家去呢  疯子
I said go home, crazy man!

512
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,140
我说了回家去
I said go home.

513
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,100
小心刺刀
Fix bayonets!!!

514
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,980
国务大臣  这位是总督察坎贝尔
Secretary of State, this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

515
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,450
丘吉尔阁下  长官
Mr Churchill, sir,

516
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,500
能得到您的召见我无比荣耀
may I say what a great honour it is to meet you.

517
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,150
短暂停留而已
Bit of a whistle stop tour.

518
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,780
-对了  你的帽子不错  -谢谢您
- Love the hat, by the way. - Thank you.

519
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,940
是海狸皮的
It's beaver.

520
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,490
那么  你来到这里的适应情况如何
So, how are you settling in?

521
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,850
我成立了一个指挥网络
I have set up a command network.

522
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,410
我在全城都安插了内线
I have agents in place across the city

523
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,130
充当我的耳目
who will act as my eyes and ears.

524
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,710
同时加大审讯嫌犯的力度
And I have begun to interrogate suspects vigorously.

525
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,860
你在贝尔法斯特待过
You were in Belfast.

526
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,810
我知道你让一些芬尼亚分子心碎
I understand you broke a few Fenian hearts.

527
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,480
老鼠窝罢了  阁下
A rat's nest, sir.

528
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,940
你觉得枪是谁偷的
So who do you think stole the guns?

529
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,930
芬尼亚成员还是共产主义分子
Fenians or Communists?

530
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,990
如果是爱尔兰共和军干的
If it is IRA Fenians,

531
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,050
我会找到他们  夺回枪支
I will find them and find the guns.

532
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,370
如果是共产主义分子  我会找到他们夺回枪支
If it is Communists, I will find them and find the guns.

533
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,690
如果是普通的罪犯  我也会找到他们夺回枪支
If it is common criminals, I will find them and find the guns.

534
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,120
对我来说  嫌犯是谁都没有差别
To me there are no distinction between any of the above.

535
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,220
我们选你就是因为你做事很有成效
We chose you because you are effective.

536
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,380
但你记住一点  坎贝尔先生 
But remember this, Mr Campbell.

537
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,930
这里是英国  不是贝尔法斯特
This is England, not Belfast.

538
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,730
尸体扔进河里  最终也会被登上报纸
Bodies thrown in the rivers, wash up in the papers here.

539
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,600
我们绝不能让新闻报道那些被偷的枪支
We must keep the existence of these stolen guns out of the news

540
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,480
否则无异于是在为那些枪打广告找买家了
otherwise we will simply be advertising them for sale.

541
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,190
如果真要弄死一些人
If there are bodies to be buried,

542
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,730
就挖洞深埋起来  要干净利落
dig holes and dig them deep.

543
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,310
我希望一切都要找回  一粒子弹都不能放过
I want everything accounted for down to the last bullet.

544
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,810
查理叔叔  跟你说句话
Uncle Charlie, a word.

545
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,260
那些都搬上船了  今晚没有月亮
They are aboard. There's no moon.

546
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,960
我们可以把这些送到格斯街那边的拐弯处
We can take them out to the turning point beyond Gas Street

547
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,770
然后丢弃在河岸上
and leave them on the bank.

548
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,210
它们很快就会被铁路工人发现
They'll be found by railway men first thing.

549
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,290
那是大家都同意的做法吗
Is that agreement?

550
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,630
我改变主意了
I changed my mind.

551
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,930
你什么
You what?

552
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,090
我还有一个备选方案
I have an alternative strategy.

553
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,210
让科利把船开到老烟草码头
Tell Curly to take her out to the old tobacco wharf.

554
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,010
那里有个停泊场  是我们以前用来存放香烟的
There's a lock up mooring we used to keep cigarettes.

555
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,090
他知道在哪儿
He knows it.

556
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,190
船离开了你的范围  你就不必担心了
When the boat leaves your yard, it's no longer your concern.

557
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,390
你他妈的是疯了吗
Have you lost your fucking mind?

558
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,730
你没看见街上的情况吗
Have you not seen the streets?

559
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,210
他们派了一支军队过来寻找这些枪支
They've sent a fucking army to find these things...

560
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,210
你说的对  他们已经显露了意图
That's right. They've shown their hand...

561
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,570
显露意图
Their hand?

562
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,180
如果他们这么急切地想找回枪支 
If they want them back this bad,

563
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,810
他们就得付出代价
they'll have to pay.

564
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,690
世道就是这样的
That's the way of the world.

565
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,180
命运把价值无限的宝贝送到你面前
Fortune drops something valuable in your lap,

566
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,330
你可不能白白就扔了出去
you don't just dump it on the bank of the cut.

567
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,810
你是我的亲人  汤米
You're blood, Tommy.

568
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,420
我一直像个父亲一样照顾你
I've always looked out for you like a dad.

569
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,330
你会招来大祸临头的
You're going to bring holy hell down on your head.

570
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,730
那个警察可不会留俘虏
This copper takes no prisoners.

571
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,790
我听说他都没服过役
I'm told he didn't serve.

572
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,320
他从事的是免服兵役的职业
Reserved occupation.

573
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,760
你想引发另一场战争吗  汤米
Is it another war you're looking for, Tommy?

574
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,680
烟草码头
The tobacco wharf.

575
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,320
剃刀党命令你这样做
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

576
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,360
你打入进去了吗
Are you in position?

577
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,460
是的  先生
I am, sir.

578
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,730
你的第一印象是什么
Your first impressions?

579
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,340
我对那些人的生活感到震惊
I am quite shocked at how these people live.

580
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,700
你搞到对我有用的信息了吗
Have you found anything out that might help me?

581
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,710
我审讯了剃刀党的头目
I interrogated the head of the Peaky Blinders.

582
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,300
他什么都不知道
He didn't know anything.

583
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,940
一个畜生
A brute.

584
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,660
我突然想到掌控谢尔比家族的不是亚瑟
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur who heads the Shelby family.

585
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,540
是年轻的那个  汤玛斯
It is the younger one, Thomas.

586
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,540
人们都说他在战场上获得过两枚英勇勋章
They say he won two medals for gallantry in the war.

587
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,510
你听上去似乎很迷恋他
You sound fascinated.

588
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,300
不过  我的想法还是没有变
However, my opinion has not changed.

589
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,940
那些经营赌马的黑帮有其他业务
The bookmaker gangs have other business

590
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,700
而共产主义分子又太弱  不可能谋划此案
and the Communists are too weak to have planned this.

591
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,980
我相信那些枪是被爱尔兰共和军劫走了
I believe the guns were taken by the IRA.

592
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:23,360
你不能让你个人的历史经历影响你的判断
You must not let your personal history cloud your judgment.

593
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,820
什么历史经历
What history?

594
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,140
爱尔兰共和军谋害了我父亲一事
That the IRA murdered my father

595
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,500
不会影响我的判断
will not affect my judgment.

596
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,210
如果你看到任何一把枪
If you see any guns,

597
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,640
就对比一下这张单子上的序列号
check the serial numbers against that list.

598
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,030
你父亲
Your father

599
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,940
是我曾共事过的最优秀的警官
was the finest officer I ever worked with.

600
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,780
我知道他一定会为你非常非常骄傲的
I know he would be very, very proud of you.

601
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,860
丹尼  你杀的那个人是意大利人
Danny, as you know, the man you killed was Italian.

602
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,660
那边那两个人是他兄弟
And those two men over there are his brothers.

603
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,820
如果我同意意大利人的处理方法  丹尼
If I let the Italians do this, Danny,

604
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,340
他们就会切掉你的生殖器  让你血尽而亡
they'll cut off your manhood and let you drain.

605
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,790
那些混蛋就是这么做事的
That's how those bastards do things.

606
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,730
所以  为了阻止我们和意大利人间发生争战
So, to stop a war breaking out between us and the Italians...

607
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,380
也让你不受他们野蛮行为的虐待
and to save you from their barbarity...

608
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,900
我说我会亲自送你上路
I said I would dispatch you myself.

609
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,460
他们是来做见证的
They are here to witness.

610
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,340
我其实早就死在战场上了  汤米
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

611
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,060
我的大脑早已埋进了那些淤泥里
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

612
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,500
你还有什么遗愿吗  兄弟
You have any last requests, comrade?

613
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,350
你会帮我照看罗丝和孩子们的吧
You'll look out for my Rosie and my boys?

614
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,180
一定要让他们当上学徒  
See they get apprenticeships.

615
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,100
在轻兵器工厂或奥斯丁汽车公司都行
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

616
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,020
他们会成为工头的  我知道他们会的
They'll make foremen. I know they will.

617
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,910
就是普通的
Just ordinary...

618
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,820
就是普通人
Just ordinary men.

619
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,940
他们不必做那些残酷的
And they won't get told to do this shit...

620
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,860
我们做过的那些  残酷恶心的事
This shit... This shit that we got told to do.

621
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,500
我觉得我现在该祈祷了
I suppose I ought to pray now.

622
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,510
那些该死的枪  让上帝彻底从我的脑海中消失
Those fucking guns blew God right out of my head.

623
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,100
那只船是为我准备的吗
Is that boat for me?

624
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,340
我们必须把你的尸体运出城  丹尼
We have to get your body out of the city, Danny.

625
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,980
那个新来的警察  你知道的
This new copper, you know...

626
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,860
不要把我埋在有淤泥的地方  好吗
Don't bury me anywhere where there's mud. OK?

627
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,500
答应我
Promise me.

628
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,740
把我埋在山上  告诉罗丝地点
Bury me on a hill and tell Rosie where.

629
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,560
你曾是个好人  也是个优秀的士兵
You were a good man and a good soldier.

630
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,900
是  军士长
Yes, Sergeant Major.

631
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,300
在凄凉的冬至日
In the bleak midwinter.

632
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,060
你去哪儿了
Where are you?

633
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,620
它竟然获胜了
It bloody won!

634
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,060
摩纳根小子竟然他妈的获胜了
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

635
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,500
是啊  它获胜了
Yeah. It won.

636
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,660
消息会传开来
And word will spread.

637
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,570
所以下次我们再施展红粉巫术时
So next time we do the powder trick

638
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,640
不仅是加里森地区的人会押那匹马
it won't just be The Garrison that'll bet on the horse,

639
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,460
整个小希斯地区的人都会押它
it'll be the whole of Small Heath.

640
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,410
你知道吗  那匹马还会再赢的
And you know what? The horse will win again.

641
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,620
第三次我们就下手
And the third time we do it

642
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,620
我们让整个伯明翰的人都押它
we'll have the whole of Birmingham betting on it.

643
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,940
一千英镑的钱押在那匹被施了魔法的马上
A thousand quid bet on the magic horse.

644
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,640
到时候
And that time,

645
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,850
等我们准备好  那匹马就会输
when we are ready, the horse will lose.

646
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,060
好好想想吧
Think about it.

647
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,900
你没事吧  丹尼
You OK, Danny?

648
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,820
我还是惊魂未定
I'm still in shock.

649
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,980
你确定这不是天堂吗
You sure this isn't heaven?

650
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,380
如果这是天堂  我怎么会在天堂呢
If it was heaven, what would I be doing here?

651
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,940
汤米希望让你觉得那是真的
Tommy wanted you to think it was real

652
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,780
想借此刺激你恢复理智
to try and knock some sense into you.

653
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,580
打在一袋羊脑上还是挺疼的
A shell full of sheep brains hurts pretty bad.

654
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,060
就该疼才对嘛
It was meant to.

655
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:10,140
-你要载我去哪儿  -伦敦
- So where are you taking me? - London.

656
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,740
汤米有个小任务让你完成  
Tommy has a little job for you.

657
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,000
给你一个表达谢意的机会
Give you chance to say thanks.

658
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,100
你现在是剃刀党的一员了  丹尼
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

659
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,700
真是糟糕的一周
A bad week.

660
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,510
昨晚没有月亮  我查过了
There was no moon last night. I checked.

661
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,810
你做出了正确的选择吗
Did you do the right thing?

662
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,060
是的  我做了正确的选择
Yes, I did the right thing.
